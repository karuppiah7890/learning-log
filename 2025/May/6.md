I have been a tech lead in VMWare, where I was working with two other colleagues. It was a small team and we were working on release engineering tools and creating tooling for testing and verifying complex software (Tanzu) that helped spin up and run and manage Kubernetes Clusters. It was open source - Tanzu Community Edition ( https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition , http://tanzucommunityedition.io )

After that, I joined Togai, an early startup back then, now acquired by Zuora. I maintained the whole of Togai infrastructure, which was on AWS. We managed the infrastructure using Terraform and Chef Cookbooks. I helped set up monitoring and alerting for some of their services. I tried to help with rising costs in monitoring. I also fixed memory leak issues. I helped them setup low cost CI/CD on GitHub Actions using our own infrastructure.

Later, I joined Ola Cabs, my last company. There I worked as a lead (SDE-3) in a team of 8, all SDE-2, with an existing lead (SDE-3). I helped mentor some of the juniors. I worked with Kubernetes Clusters, CI/CD pipelines, Developer Platform (Backstage , https://backstage.io ), Hashicorp Vault for Secrets Management. I built tools whenever necessary. I also helped Security Team with Security Compliance.

I liked mentoring and teaching people in the project. I also learned a lot from the people in the project. I customized our ways of working based on the team's comfort. I always tried to ensure that the project people had enough psychological safety to talk about anything they want by being very frank and always addressing the elephant in the room
