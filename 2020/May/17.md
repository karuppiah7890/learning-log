Apparently kafka doesn't need zookeeper anymore.
https://www.confluent.io/blog/removing-zookeeper-dependency-in-kafka/
I don't know anything about Kafka but I do know it's quite a task to
run zookeeper first and then run kafka, and it's kind of like multiple
things to run and know about and if someone's an Ops person and manages
kafka, one extra component to manage with zookeeper. But looks like that's
gonna change. One less component to know about, one less component to worry
about! :) Cool

There's a thing called DOI - Document Object Identifier - https://doi.org .
I found these doi.org links when checking out research papers. Apparently,
it's some unique identifier - looks like a URL shortener service to me,
anyways, it's a good link to have, and using this link, you can easily
download research papers - free and paid ;) :P :P from this site - Sci Hub -
