Today I checked out this site

http://www.parallelentrepreneurship.com/

It's about Parallel Entrepreneurship. A parallel entrepreneur is someone who
starts off a business, and also do their day job in parallel!

I do have to see the legalities of this. Don't want to end up in a bad
situation not knowing what are the laws related to such a thing, if I do it,
when I'm in my current company. Same applies to if I want to try freelancing
in weekends.

I got the first chapter of the book. Not sure if I should get the book. I already
have tons of books that I'm yet to read!

Apparently it's ~450 INR now. It's usual price is ~1270 INR it seems.

I read the intro in the site. The author is talking about software businesses
and small ones, not too big and ones with just a few users and not millions,
and these are business users - that is, the author is talking about Business
to Business (B2B) products, not consumer facing products.

I'm guessing providing a service, for example cloud service, API service, and all
is B2B. But I need to validate! :)
