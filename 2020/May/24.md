Today I learned that `$ cd -` works using this environment variable
called `$OLDPWD`. So, when you do `cd`, I don't know who sets it,
may be `cd`, but the env var `$OLDPWD` is set to the old directory,
so that when `$ cd -` is called, then it can go back to the old
directory. And if it's the first time the shell has opened, and
if you try `$ cd -`, then it showd this error `-bash: cd: OLDPWD not set`
and that's how I found out :) and yes, you can check the `$OLDPWD`
using `$ echo $OLDPWD`
