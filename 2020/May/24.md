Today I learned that `$ cd -` works using this environment variable
called `$OLDPWD`. So, when you do `cd`, I don't know who sets it,
may be `cd`, but the env var `$OLDPWD` is set to the old directory,
so that when `$ cd -` is called, then it can go back to the old
directory. And if it's the first time the shell has opened, and
if you try `$ cd -`, then it showd this error `-bash: cd: OLDPWD not set`
and that's how I found out :) and yes, you can check the `$OLDPWD`
using `$ echo $OLDPWD`

Today I learned about the `say` command in MacOS. My friend had mentioned
it to me earlier when talking about, you know, having some automated
voice telling me the time every hour, so that I can keep "track of time".
I have an app in my Android phone for that, which uses the system alarm
for this, a repeated alarm with a custom sound as the alarm sound, to tell
the time.

What my friend did was - he used the `crontab` for running an hourly
cronjob and for the job - he used the `say` command and used the
`date` command to find the time at that particular instant and the
`say` would just tell the command given the string of words.

And there are multiple voices that can be used with the `say` command

```
$ say "Hi"
$ man say
$ say -v ?
$ say -v Veena Hi
$ say -v Alex Hi
```

That was fun. I think I'll set it up too. May be not today? :P I'm
bored and lazy? :P

Okay. I felt it wouldn't take much time and did it anyway. :P

`crontab` messed with me for a bit. Got this error

`crontab: temp file must be edited in place`

Apparently vim edits a copy of the file and then writes to the original
later, and `crontab` misses it and all. I finally used `nano`

Use this site for getting my cron time right

https://crontab.guru/#0_*_*_*_*

This is the script - `sayTime.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

hourNumber=$( date "+%I" | sed 's/^0*//' )
say "It's $hourNumber o clock"

```

and the crontab content -

```
$ chmod +x ~/sayTime.sh
$ EDITOR=nano crontab -e
crontab: installing new crontab
$ crontab -l
0 * * * * ~/sayTime.sh
```

And it works! :) I tried a different cron time to check in between
the hour, like

```
40 * * * * ~/sayTime.sh
```

and then changed it back after I saw it works! :)

Today I saw some really cool videos

"My journey to success | Aishwarya Rajesh | TEDxIIMTrichy"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zls4a7I_qaM

Aishwarya Rajesh talks about how she and her family struggled
and how she worked and entered in the cinema industry, which
is usually looking for some stereotypical actresses. She tells
how she lost two brothers and had to step up and contribute
to take care of her mother and one brother. She tried to get
into the TV series, but her salary was low and she would have
to work only on some days it seems. Apparently her mom told that
she would get more money if she worked in movies and was famous
and an established actress. And she then started for trying in
movies. She even won the dancing reality show Maanaada Mayilaada
it seems. It's the season 3. I just found out here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Pl-m4EwYY . And she got very
few films it seems. She got criticized a lot it seems, in
different ways - that she was black, her complexion, she talks
Tamil, and what not. She said she knew how to handle it. She
tells that all women should know how to handle criticisms and
sexual harrasments. It was inspiring to watch her tell her
story. She says at the end that, if she can do it, anyone can.

microbes can help us with a prolonged and healthy life :)
