I read this blog today - 

https://ardalis.com/the-more-you-know-the-more-you-realize-you-dont-know

A good one. Made a lot of sense. I guess I have tons to learn ðŸ™ˆ I got to know
by digging and finding the unknown unknowns!

Started thinking about how to gear up for Hacktoberfest 2020. Started noting
down thoughts. Will write a blog post about it I guess! :)

I have lots of small small stuff that I learned from organizing events. I think
I must note it all down :) I have some stuff written in my diary actually.

Finally my PR for gchat-threadlink has been merged :D

https://github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/pull/2

I think there's a new thing in my backlog :P 

https://github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/issues/5

I gotta see how the addon is currently released manually and then see how to
automate the process - configs, secret tokens needed for auth etc. It will be
fun to check it out! ;)
