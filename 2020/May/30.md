I learned about this term called `Fork Bomb` today

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb

Looks more like a recursive function, but one that doesn't end (no base case).

Found it in this video

Running the below `Fork Bomb` in a shell can make things crazy

```bash
$ :() { : | : & }; :
```

In the above fork bomb, we define a function called `:` (colon) and in it's
definition, we call itself and we pipe it's output to itself which is running
in the background. And after we are done defining it, we call the function `:`.
So, what happens is, it goes on and on and on.

Today I finished checking out the whole `Containers from Scratch` video and
also tried it out in my machine. It took two days for me ðŸ˜… I mean, in between
I was seeing TV series and all. But yeah, I finally got to finishing it. It
was only a 42 minute video. Anyways, I noted down everything about it here
