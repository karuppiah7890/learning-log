So, today I was simply writing down what I don't know.
I guess I don't know anything ðŸ™ˆ I can clearly see I
have a big list of I don't knows, and for "I knows",
I can't think of much. So. I'm just going to see what
to do about that.

For now, I heard some of the upcoming projects probably
will be using Angular and some of them will be using
.NET Core. So, I thought - why not try .NET Core? :P
Simply. I mean, I have been shying away from learning
new languages, and usually I start and leave in a day
or so. I think it might happen again. Let's see. For
a second I was thinking what's my goal - I think my
goal will be to write an API with .NET Core. I don't
know anything but that will be my goal. I'll make it
work first and try to understand what's going on
behind the scenes! :) I'll think about testing and
stuff later. I'll also try to run it in Mac and Linux
(Docker?). And I'll also see what editor to use. People
have suggested quite some - Rider, Visual Studio. I
don't have those. I think I'll try VS Code for now! :)

So, I'm here. 

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core

I'm choosing .NET Core 3.1 as that's the stable and LTS
version and I can see version 5.0 . Weird that I can't
find version 4.x

I was here

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1

I can see something about "Build apps - SDK" and "Run apps - Runtime".
I chose SDK 3.1.300 for the SDK and was thinking about using the macos installer.
But I wanted to try the hard way to see how hard or crazy it is. I got the
binary for macos instead. Over here

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.300-macos-x64-binaries

And I see a hello world tutorial link 

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro

I like this! :) ;)

And I can see some more links for .NET

Videos https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/videos
Community https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/community
and ML! Hmm https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet

Okay, I'll check the video and then also see what installing `dotnet` means.
Let's see how crazy or hard it is to install `dotnet` without a fancy installer!
:) 

For the SDKs, I saw something about supported languages. And it said C# and F#.
And it also spoke about included runtimes. I thought I had to get the "runtime"
separately. But in my local, I was able to run the `dotnet` binary and check
the runtimes! ;)

```
$ ~/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/dotnet
# the above didn't work because of macos security issues.
# so I did this.
$ sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/dotnet
$ ~/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/dotnet
# it didn't work again.
# another file security issue. Used
# Security Preferences and allowed the file
# and then this worked!
$ ~/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/dotnet

Usage: dotnet [options]
Usage: dotnet [path-to-application]

Options:
  -h|--help         Display help.
  --info            Display .NET Core information.
  --list-sdks       Display the installed SDKs.
  --list-runtimes   Display the installed runtimes.

path-to-application:
  The path to an application .dll file to execute.

$ ~/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/dotnet --list-runtimes
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.4 [/Users/karuppiahn/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]
Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.4 [/Users/karuppiahn/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]
```

So I can run `dotnet` I guess. With ease. And I guess it also includes the
runtimes. But may be the security issue would not be there if I had used
the installers. Hmm. Anyways. I gotta move this directory inside
`/usr/local/`. 

And I did just that!

```
$ sudo mv ~/Downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.300-osx-x64/ /usr/local/dotnet
$ subl ~/.bash_profile
# and added this
# export PATH="/usr/local/dotnet:$PATH"
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ dotnet

Usage: dotnet [options]
Usage: dotnet [path-to-application]

Options:
  -h|--help         Display help.
  --info            Display .NET Core information.
  --list-sdks       Display the installed SDKs.
  --list-runtimes   Display the installed runtimes.

path-to-application:
  The path to an application .dll file to execute.

$ dotnet --list-runtimes
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.4 [/usr/local/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]
Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.4 [/usr/local/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]

$ dotnet --list-sdks
3.1.300 [/usr/local/dotnet/sdk]
```

Awesome! :) So, installation is done. I'll continue with the 101 video
I guess! 

I saw some of the videos. It used Visual Studio and was running a command
line program in C#. They actually recommended to watch the previous series
about C#. I think I need to do that first and then move on building a web
service / microservice :)
