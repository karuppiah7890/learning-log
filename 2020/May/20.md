# May 20th 2020

So, I'm finishing up my PR for the issue
https://github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/issues/1

PR: https://github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/pull/2

I tested the code - that is, the permissions part, by checking some docs.

https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/test-permission-requests/#observe-or-verify-install-time-permission-requests

I first tried to install without a `xpi` or `zip` file, firefox just disabled the
open button in the explorer for the directory or the `manifest.json`. I didn't
check the docs properly ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ Then I made a `zip` myself using this

```bash
$ zip -r gchat-threadlink.zip gchat-threadlink/
```

Funnily it even zipped my `.git` directory, but I didn't care and this time
I was allowed to choose the zip, but later it said the file was corrupted.

Later I found out that I wasn't supposed to do it like that. And found this doc

https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/#packaging-your-extension

And then I got `web-ext`, which I didn't have for some reason. I think it's
because I upgraded my `node` version once and got rid of the old one. And then
I ran the command to create the zip

```bash
$ npm i -g web-ext
$ # inside addon directory
$ web-ext build
Building web extension from /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink
Your web extension is ready: /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/web-ext-artifacts/gchat_threadlink-1.0.zip
```

And to rebuild, that doesn't work

```bash
$ web-ext build
Building web extension from /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink

s: Extension exists at the destination path: /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/web-ext-artifacts/gchat_threadlink-1.0.zip
Use --overwrite-dest to enable overwriting.
```

So I had to use an extra option for it, called `--overwrite-dest` as the error
says. So I did it then

```bash
$ web-ext build --overwrite-dest
Building web extension from /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink
Destination exists, overwriting: /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/web-ext-artifacts/gchat_threadlink-1.0.zip
Your web extension is ready: /Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/sriv/gchat-threadlink/web-ext-artifacts/gchat_threadlink-1.0.zip
```

And I changed the `xpinstall.signatures.required` settings in `about:config`
in Firefox to `false` and then in the addons page `about:addons`, clicked the
small gear and chose the option to `Install Add-on From File...` and chose the
zip file and it asked for permissions then. Below is a screenshot

Now, I gotta work on some comments. So, with the existing code, I had actually
used closures and created many functions for the `onclick` event handling. A
better thing could have been, use the `event` object of the click and getting
the data from the element that has been clicked and then using that data.
I was using a `span` tag, that's fine, I could have added some extra attribute,
like how I have seen people add some `data` attribute or something. I gotta
see how to use the `event` object to get the clicked element's attribute values.

Also, I have been asked to just change the `a` tag's behavior instead of adding
another element. I think it makes sense. I just think about one thing - will
it still be possible to right click and copy the link as before? I don't know,
I'll have to check that. So, the idea now is - people click the `a` tag and it
doesn't follow the link which is what usually the anchor tag does, and instead
the link is copied to clipboard. And I also got some more comments

So, what I gotta do is -
* Get rid of the `span` tag
* Add the feature to `a` tag and prevent the default behavior of `a` tag
* Try to use the `event` object of the click event instead of creating tons
of functions for multiple threads / links
* Don't print to console for success. Print only for failure

Okay, so I finished the first two. In between I had a small hiccup where I
thought the extension's behavior was not working, the link being wrong. I don't
know how it went wrong. Later found out it works okay and that google hasn't
changed anything in their behavior.

Oh. Wait. I found out! I think I'm going to solve that issue separately by
putting an issue for it first and discuss thoughts :)

The issue is this - after going to a thread using the thread specific link,
the addon doesn't work, as it keeps appending the thread's id to the document
URL, which is different in different situations.

Also, one more issue I noticed is - the addon doesn't put links for all threads.
The reason is because it loads once when the page loads and that's it. But
google is dynamically loading threads, so when you scroll up or down and threads
are dynamically shown, the addon is already done it's work and will not be
adding links to these new dynamically shown threads. Gotta raise an issue for
that too! :)

Now, back to business. I gotta remove the multiple functions first. Actually,
I removed the console log for success. I don't know if I can get rid of the
`.then()`. For now I'm leaving it alone. Back to multiple functions!

So, for `event` objects, this is what I found - 

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_mouseevent.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_relatedtarget.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=try_dom_event_relatedtarget

So, I tried the example with `onclick` and it didn't work out. It said
`event.relatedTarget` is `null`

I did see this one other example which looked cool! :) Something like this

```html
<p onclick="myFunction(this, 'red')">Click me to change my text color.</p>
```

But for this I have to write the function definition inside the html. Hmm.

Awesome! So I tried this -

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<a href="blah" onclick="return myFunction(this, 'red')">Click me to change my text color.</a>
<a href="bloo" onclick="return myFunction(this, 'red')">Click me to change my text color.</a>


<script>
function myFunction(elmnt,clr) {
  elmnt.style.color = clr;
  console.log(elmnt.href)
  return false;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

And it worked well! Initially I didn't know / understand how the html `onclick`
attribute was working. So apparently I can put both Js code in the string, or
assign it a function value which will get called later. In this case, I have
to do it in html and use the `this` in it. That way I get the element that has
been clicked and it just works! :)

Okay. So. I'm not able to set the string for `a` tag like this

```js
a.onclick = 'return copyToClipboard(this);'
```

It just doesn't even show up in the webpage. I can see other attributes, but
not this one. Hmm.

I'm checking this question 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3007336/how-do-you-assign-a-javascript-onclick-attribute-dynamically#3007402

So, I noticed a good point about using `addEventListener` instead of assigning
to `onclick`. I think I could do that. Hmm.

Damn. I actually remember learning about these.

Found this

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_document_addeventlistener

After little bit of craziness, I made things work

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<a href="blah" id="demo">something</a><br>
<a href="bloo" id="demo1">something else</a>


<script>
let a = document.getElementById("demo")
let a1 = document.getElementById("demo1")
a.addEventListener("click", function(event){
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log(event.target.href)
  return false
});
a1.addEventListener("click", function(event){
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log(event.target.href)
  return false
});

</script>

</body>
</html>
```

So, that's what I'm going to do! Yay! :) Cleaner way of doing things! :)

Some links that helped to confirm my doubts for preventing default :)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/265478/preventdefault-on-an-a-tag#265499
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_preventdefault.asp

One more thing to notice is, the `click` event doesn't fire up for right
clicking. I wanted to know this - as I wanted to check if people can still
right click and copy link like before, more like trying to understand is the
new feature working without breaking existing behaviour :) So, when you right
click, it's just a right click, and it doesn't copy to your clipboard. You can
click the link for that, or right click and choose copy link too! :)

Awesome! Everything works and I manually tested it! :)

And I also made the change of extracting the anonymous function to a named
function. That way, there aren't too many anonymous functions. And just
references to the same function! :) And the function is general, so all cool! :)

And I tested it again manuall. I guess there could be some e2e tests for this :P
Hmm :P Not gonna be an easy one though. Anyways, that's too much effort for now,
I guess, for a simple tool like this :)

Let me go and put the issues that I found out now! :)

I have put the two issues I mentioned! :)

I read this blog post now

https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/14/the-most-successful-developers-share-more-than-they-take/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_overflow_newsletter

It felt really cool to know how sharing helps. Funnily I just type loads of text
based on my research for building stuff - a lot of times I just compile a lot of
links but hardly read them - example - research papers :P and multiple github
projects. I guess it will get better some day. 

The one thing that made me think was the `public by default` part - I mean,
yeah, a lot of times my projects have been public, but recently, I have been
thinking about creating a product, a paid product, for which I have gone for a
private repo, but yeah, most of my research is in public üôà it's a lot of work.
Sometimes I think if I should just pull back all that research data and put
it in a separate repo if it's related to the product and have it as private?
Idk. For now I guess it's okay. I think I'll also simply check what Tesla
company does. I remember people telling me how Tesla opens up and shares their
blueprint for stuff. I need to check it out. I guess my research on the
Internet being open will be something like that, but the code will not be open
I guess. Hmm :P Anyways, it was a good read. The author had also mentioned
about their podcast

https://distinguisheddevs.com/

Which I might check later. It sounds like a cool one, interviewing awesome
people! :)

I was lurking in Linkedin as usualy today. Found this blog post about hiring

https://www.geektrust.in/blog/2020/05/11/identify-good-developers-based-on-real-world-skills-now-is-the-time/

made me think about how one part of hiring could be - giving some big real
world problems to candidates and see how they think. How they solve the problem.
And it needs to be an open book test. Meaning they can use the Internet and do
whatever. How do they solve the problem. In my case, I have recently found out
that research papers and protocols and standards are an awesome thing - many
people have already solved tons of problems. The best thing to do is - 
understand the problem, understand the different solutions and implementations,
and then see what to do next, and definitely try to reuse existing code if it's
good and works, instead of writing one from scratch. I mean, some developers
have spent years and done tons of commits to softwares, and you are not gonna
consider all of that and say "meh, I'll write it myself"? I would say - Good
Luck with that. But yeah, one thing is true - if you do rewrite, the pros are -
you will learn a lot. Surely. :) From mistakes, successes, everything. And you
might even succeed in making something better than the existing famous software.
So, that's also a thing that people do, so üëç But if you are just doing it for
the sake of doing it, reconsider your decisions. :) Think about the "Why?".
Be lazy to write code :)

I recently thought about some good problems and wanted to put them in the
hiring problems list to just see how candidates approach it. Not sure if our
recruitment will be able to use the problems. It's a bit of a new thing and I
don't know if it will fit - as it needs a lot of time to solve and there's
usually some time constraints on how much time we have with the candidate for
every round

I recently saw these cool videos about writing code and stuff

Hammock Driven Development - Rich Hickey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc

YOW! Conference 2018 - Avdi Grimm - #nocode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o58SR_9Id0

It was really good. 

Hammock Driven Development - Rich Hickey - it's about thinking about a problem
before coding. It's about catching bugs while designing by reducing design
issues.

YOW! Conference 2018 - Avdi Grimm - #nocode - it's about trying to avoid code
as much as possible. As code is a liability, it's maintenance, so, try to
write as little as possible.

Another is this -
"The Mess We're In" by Joe Armstrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4&t=1577s

It's a good video that gives you insights about the different kinds of mess we
are in. And some good ideas!

Saw a non-tech video recently

Noam Chomsky on COVID & ECONOMY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi6ae6kZNqE

It was a really good one! It made me think about global warming and about how
there are so many issues in the world that needs to be looked into. I also found
out about Noam Chomsky.

So I had to watch a video to understand how to change the profile picture in
this software called Workday

"How to Add or Change Your Photo in Workday"

I wish it was easier to change my profile pic... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
