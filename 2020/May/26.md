Today I learned about Docker Swarm not having proper support for Canary Deployments.
Docker Enterprise has some round robin traffic split feature it seems, and that's it,
because of which you need to depend on number of instances if you want a traffic split
based on percentage.

A colleague explained this and told how they checked different strategies like traefik, envoy and finally went with envoy proxy along with some more components to help with this.

The only thing that was going on in my head was - why do we have so much complex stuff to do for a Canary Deployment? I mean, every infra platform needs to help people in a basic way at least. 

So, they used a tool called Envoy Pilot with consul. In consul there were configurations, which could be dynamically updated to configure the envoy proxy.

This configuration had the traffic percentage and other configs. Using this and by putting the application behind the envoy proxy, they were able to achieve canary deployment.
