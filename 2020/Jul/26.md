So, I opened up my browser
and was again reading some
duckduckgo stuff in
duckduckgo.com when
checking what's the difference
between that and 
start.duckduckgo.com . Realized the
former is more of a extra info 
website and not minimalistic like
start.duckduckgo.com . Anyways,
I finally removed the Google 
Analytics tracker from my website
after reading those stuff and long
ago it was on my mind, I have finally
done it. My friend used to suggest it
too. 

I put the below in my commit message
of my blog repo, while remove google
analytics

```
I figured that I was having double standards.
I block trackers and ads and what not with
extensions. I'm not so much into hating
tracking and ads like some people, but I
do have them enabled. Also, I don't even
see the google analytics dashboard much
anymore. Also, I don't see a point in it.
I mean, I don't blog to get more users
to see my blog or get more followers.
It would be cool to get many though! :P
Google Analytics was just one way to know
if I have any followers and if my content
is useful to people and which content is
useful. I think the comments and reactions
can help with that. Removing this tracking
thing for now :)

Btw, yesterday, I was checking out
coding communities. General ones
and ones that teach particularly to
kids. These are the links I checked
out

http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/about/

http://www.edutechpost.com/coding-for-kids-free-websites-teach-learn-programming/

https://codingforcommunity.org/

https://codingandcommunity.org/

https://www.saturdaykids.com/social-mission/code-in-the-community/
https://www.codeinthecommunity.com/

https://www.khanacademy.org/

https://www.freecodecamp.org/

And a few days ago, I also checked 
out

https://www.blackgirlscode.com/

https://anitab.org/

and some more I think. All these
communities, do code, teach code.
Some of them are specifically for
kids. Some of them are for
underprivileged people. People who
are at a disadvantage in general,
when compared to others, for reasons
such as them being a minority
group, them being poor, their age,
their gender, their ethnicity and
what not.

I kind of like teaching. So I
approached one of them asking if
I can help, so that I can do
something productive and useful for
the community and not spend all that
time on Netflix ðŸ™ˆ

Data stuff!

Some more statistics stuff that
can be done with pandas data frame!

```python
# mode
dataFrame["columnName"].mode()

# standard deviation
dataFrame["columnName"].std()
```

Learned a bit about animations
in google slides presentation.
Just a bit. I was trying to
change an animation. Realized that
all the elements for the animation
are shown for editing and only
during slide show the full animation
of zooming in and out happens

I checked this youtube video a bit

Okay, so I was checking this
github repo and found out that
some files have some weird content
and then ignored it since I didn't
understand it and started to find
different ways to get that file

This is one of those files -
https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Data-Analysis/blob/master/univariate_dist/data/flights.csv

Later I realized that this person
who pushed this file to their
repo wasn't doing anything wrong.
They were infact using this
thing called Git LFS - Git Large
File System. I actually understood
just the short form but didn't
understand how to get the file.
I think I gave in to my ignorance
and chucked it.

I just now started digging into
how to get that data because the
data I have seems to be not the
exact data he has. So I kind of
became desperate :P

I jumped into a site when I went
to this link

https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1

Which is to this site

https://git-lfs.github.com/

Installed Git LFS in my local
with homebrew using
`brew install git-lfs`

Looks like Git LFS is more like
a GitHub thing? Maybe. Maybe not.
Gotta check. Gotta dig more.

Saw this video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLR1RNqJ1Mw

But all this didn't help me to
get that large file this guy used
in his repo.

Apparently it's not just for
GitHub

The damn thing is paid and there
are some quotas and it's over
for this repo apparently

```bash
$ git lfs fetch
fetch: Fetching reference refs/heads/master
batch response: This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.
batch response: This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.
error: failed to fetch some objects from 'https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Data-Analysis.git/info/lfs'
