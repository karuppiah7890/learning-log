I checking about how to do a
GitLab contribution. I had thought
about this before.

Noticed that some people from
India are working in GitLab. Cool!
I remember seeing some people from
Chennai, now I saw two developers
from other cities, surely there are
more. I'm not checking much now

I was checking two issues in 
gitlab runner - since it's in golang,
something I know to some extent

I started reading the contributing
guide, which is the most basic and
first thing to do. Instead of as 
usual jumping head first into the
swimming pool :P

Some stuff :
* There's a gitter channel for
contributors
* There are some people called
Merge Request Coaches
* Check reviewers and maintainers
here -
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/

For gitlab runner - 
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-runner

This is to be able to mention
the reviewers and maintainers in
issues and MRs

* Product team members can be
found here -
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-categories/

For gitlab-runner -
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-categories/#runner-group

* For other questions or feedback
- contributors@gitlab.com

* There's a page for development
stuff here -

https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/development/

It asks to get something called
a GDK - GitLab Development Kit

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit

I see it's a GitLab rails development
thingy. I don't know if I need it
for GitLab Runner development too.
May be, may be not. Gotta see.
In general, it can help with
running GitLab in the local easily
it seems, in an isolated manner,
and is used by GitLab team members
and by the community too

* GitLab runner contribution guide
is too simple and generic -

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

* Some links related to general
contribution -

* Getting help

* Contribution flow

I just checked out the basic stuff
in GitLab contribution. Didn't do
much ðŸ™ˆ I guess I'll do some day.
Not today I guess. I still gotta
see what to do about those left
out open source contributions that
I still have to do. The internal
committments or the external
committments. Hmm.

Recently I have been checking out
the materials and code of a
data analysis using python workshop.

This is the second part to another
workshop in which I helped recently,
which is the Introduction to python
workshop. Both of these are by She
Loves Data community.

The intro to python workshop -
https://shelovesdata.com/event/intro-to-python-webinar2020/

I was helping with it by being
a mentor. It wasn't too much.
I had checked out the code and
slides and other material that
came with the workshop content
before hand itself, so that I
could help with mentoring. It
was my first time doing proper
python. I even learned some extra
stuff like how to use lambda
expressions in python and how
to do `.map`, `.filter` and all.
But I think I might have to look
again but it won't be that hard
again I think. Also, I learned
map, filter, reduce using JavaScript
and I learned them pretty clear
with the concepts, so all good I
guess. It's just a matter of
syntax then.

Anyways, I learned it all a few
days before the event and went for
it and was able to help good enough
because I had made sure that I knew
most of the exercises and had tried
them all and knew the answers to
them. I helped to some extent,
not so much. But I learned well.

Now I have signed up to help
with the second workshop too.
I guess I like to learn when
I'm supposed to teach. Also, I
think it's one of the best ways
to learn - mostly practically. Like
in terms of code and programming,
I tend to ask questions, tend to
see how things work, ask some whys.
Sometimes I'm lazy yes, and I just
move on once it runs. I think I'll
have to do less of that and
understand better for going to the
next level. So yeah, more whys,
and answers to those whys, and
also understanding concepts too.
And experimenting.

So for this data analysis workshop,
I tried the jupyter notebooks a
bit that we had already used. I
understood things a bit. I still
need to check more on them and
complete all the exercises too.

Today, I also realized that
freecodecamp.org has a course on
data analysis. Cool huh? I plan to
take it and learn it soon. Or
may be slow and steady, or else
it's too much rushing and pressure
and stress I guess
