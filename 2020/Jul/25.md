I checking about how to do a
GitLab contribution. I had thought
about this before.

Noticed that some people from
India are working in GitLab. Cool!
I remember seeing some people from
Chennai, now I saw two developers
from other cities, surely there are
more. I'm not checking much now

I was checking two issues in 
gitlab runner - since it's in golang,
something I know to some extent

I started reading the contributing
guide, which is the most basic and
first thing to do. Instead of as 
usual jumping head first into the
swimming pool :P

Some stuff :
* There's a gitter channel for
contributors
* There are some people called
Merge Request Coaches
* Check reviewers and maintainers
here -
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/

For gitlab runner - 
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-runner

This is to be able to mention
the reviewers and maintainers in
issues and MRs

* Product team members can be
found here -
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-categories/

For gitlab-runner -
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-categories/#runner-group

* For other questions or feedback
- contributors@gitlab.com

* There's a page for development
stuff here -

https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/development/

It asks to get something called
a GDK - GitLab Development Kit

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit

I see it's a GitLab rails development
thingy. I don't know if I need it
for GitLab Runner development too.
May be, may be not. Gotta see.
In general, it can help with
running GitLab in the local easily
it seems, in an isolated manner,
and is used by GitLab team members
and by the community too

* GitLab runner contribution guide
is too simple and generic -

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

* Some links related to general
contribution -

* Getting help

* Contribution flow

I just checked out the basic stuff
in GitLab contribution. Didn't do
much ðŸ™ˆ I guess I'll do some day.
Not today I guess. I still gotta
see what to do about those left
out open source contributions that
I still have to do. The internal
committments or the external
committments. Hmm.

Recently I have been checking out
the materials and code of a
data analysis using python workshop.

This is the second part to another
workshop in which I helped recently,
which is the Introduction to python
workshop. Both of these are by She
Loves Data community.

The intro to python workshop -
https://shelovesdata.com/event/intro-to-python-webinar2020/

I was helping with it by being
a mentor. It wasn't too much.
I had checked out the code and
slides and other material that
came with the workshop content
before hand itself, so that I
could help with mentoring. It
was my first time doing proper
python. I even learned some extra
stuff like how to use lambda
expressions in python and how
to do `.map`, `.filter` and all.
But I think I might have to look
again but it won't be that hard
again I think. Also, I learned
map, filter, reduce using JavaScript
and I learned them pretty clear
with the concepts, so all good I
guess. It's just a matter of
syntax then.

Anyways, I learned it all a few
days before the event and went for
it and was able to help good enough
because I had made sure that I knew
most of the exercises and had tried
them all and knew the answers to
them. I helped to some extent,
not so much. But I learned well.

Now I have signed up to help
with the second workshop too.
I guess I like to learn when
I'm supposed to teach. Also, I
think it's one of the best ways
to learn - mostly practically. Like
in terms of code and programming,
I tend to ask questions, tend to
see how things work, ask some whys.
Sometimes I'm lazy yes, and I just
move on once it runs. I think I'll
have to do less of that and
understand better for going to the
next level. So yeah, more whys,
and answers to those whys, and
also understanding concepts too.
And experimenting.

So for this data analysis workshop,
I tried the jupyter notebooks a
bit that we had already used. I
understood things a bit. I still
need to check more on them and
complete all the exercises too.

Today, I also realized that
freecodecamp.org has a course on
data analysis. Cool huh? I plan to
take it and learn it soon. Or
may be slow and steady, or else
it's too much rushing and pressure
and stress I guess

Pandas - Dataframes

```python
## df is a dataframe object
df.shape
df.info()
df.describe()
```

```python
# sales is a dataframe
# Unit_Cost is a Variable / Column /
# Series
sales['Unit_Cost'].describe()
sales['Unit_Cost'].mean()
sales['Unit_Cost'].median()
```

We do visualization directly
from pandas, internally it uses
matplotlib

plots:
* kind='box' - box plot
* kind='density' - density plot
* kind='hist' - histogram
* kind='pie' - pie chart
* kind='bar' - bar chart
* kind='scatter' - scatter plot


```python
sales['Age_Group'].value_counts()
```

Gets the different values
in the column and their counts.
Helpful for categorical data.
for example, different categories
for age groups - Youth, Adult,
Seniors, Young Adults. If the
column contains only one of these
values for each observation (row),
we can count the values of these.
This is more like enum data in the
columns, which has only a possible
set of discrete values. So, 
`value_counts()` will be useful
for enum data in columns

```python
sales.corr()
```

Correlation analysis. Correlation
between different columns, in
the form of a matrix with both
rows and columns being colum names
and the values in the matrix being
the correlation value. I think this
is based on the math formula to
find the correlation value.

1.0 is a high correlation value.
I think the highest. The values
are usually floating point -
decimal points and less than 1.
There are possibilities of
negative values too - meaning
negative correlation.

If it's close to 1, it means the
columns - properties, are highly
correlated!



Questions
* Mean, Median and Mode?

Learned it from here
https://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm

Mean - take up all the values, add it
up and then divide it by the number
of values.

Median - take up all the values,
arrange them (sort them) in 
increasing / ascending order. In this
list, the value that comes in the
middle of the list, is called the
median. Gotta see how it works when
the number of values are even, as
there are two middles in that case,
unlike odd number of values.

Okay, when the number of values
are even, you have two middle
values and you take the mean
of those two middle values to get
the median.

I have learned about percentile
before and looks like the median is 
50th percentile. Confirmed it here -
https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-mean-and-vs-median-and-vs-mode/

There's something about quartile
and decile too there. From the
name, I'm assuming - percentile -
is to denote that the total number
of parts is 100, and for quartile -
total number of parts is 4, and for
decile - total number of parts is 10.

Mode - the most frequently occuring
value is the mode. If no value
is repeated in the data, then there's
no mode

* What is Box plot?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Cx7xuIXig

It's essentially a box showing
the 25th percentile, 50th percentile
(median) and the 75th percentile,
and the remaining values - the ones
that are less than the 25th
percentile and ones that are greater
than the 75th percentile. Something
called "whiskers" I think

It gives a good sense about the
spread of values

Apparently both are the same,
box plot and whisker plot
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/box-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib/

* What's figsize?

Come to think of it, since it's 
a named parameter for the plot
method and all I see are diagrams
or plots or "figures", I just
realized it could be "figure size".
Gotta confirm this!

Seems like it does mean
figure size, seeing this -
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42215252/inconsistency-when-setting-figure-size-using-pandas-plot-method

I also checked here
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/04_plotting.html

and here in docs
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html

both places didn't tell much
about figsize

* How to import pandas? I get
some module not found error and all

Import is done like this

```python
import pandas
```

And we need to first get the
pandas library, for which I did

```bash
$ pip install pandas
```

And then used the import statement
in the python REPL (read evaluate
print loop)

* What is density plot?

* What is histogram?
