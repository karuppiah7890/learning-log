Today I learned how to create a personalized meeting url.
Like I have seen my colleagues give me their name as their
zoom meeting ID instead of some big number!

I finally found out how to do that ;)

It's called a personal link and it can be customized. This is
for personal meeting IDs only, as far as I know.

I created my personal link as `karuppiah` :) I was planning to
keep it shorter `karup` or `karups` or something like that,
but it's okay, I want to see how this one works. If it's harder,
then I'll choose something else :D
