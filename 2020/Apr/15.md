So, we had implemented an endpoint in one
of our services. It was a GET endpoint to
get a resource. But this endpoint needed some
parameters / input based on which it can
return different data. Now, we thought that
this input will be large - an array of
elements - integers, ie IDs, and we had to
return the resources for each of these IDs.

We created a GET endpoint yes, and we took
the decision that it will have a request body.
Apparently HTTP does not restrict having
request body for GET, but yes, conventionally,
GET requests do not have a request body. But
we implemented it. The reason being we thought
that the list of IDs could get long and a URL
can only be so long. There's a limit to it.
So, moved the parameter to the request body.

After our implementation, when implementing
the client side, which in our case is an 
Android App, we noticed that the retrofit 
library that we used didn't support sending
a GET request with a request body.

One way to solve this would have been to use
another client library for this call alone -
but then that would be inconsistent and also
retrofit seems to be one of the best libraries
to use. So, of course, we had no options but
to change our backend to not have request
body for a GET request. And instead use
query parameters.

We then did exactly that. One query param
with a single value, another with a list
of values separated by commas
