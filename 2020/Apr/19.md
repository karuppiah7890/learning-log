So, today I was trying to learn how to create a mac os app.
I got xcode. I followed this blog post a bit

https://troz.net/post/2019/swiftui-for-mac-1/

but I didn't understand too much. And my aim was to create
another cursor apart from the cursor that's already there.
This is for the two cursors feature for the remote
pairing tool. 

Some of the links I checked out are 

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscursor
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscursor/1534665-sethiddenuntilmousemoves
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscursor/1529096-hotspot?language=objc

I wasn't able to do much though. I kept meddling, but I didn't know what I
was doing ðŸ™ˆ

Anyways, at some point it felt like I can't do two cursors by seeing the docs.
And it was very clear I need to learn some Swift, and do better ðŸ™ˆ I was beating
around the bush A LOT! May be two cursors can be done. I was just done for now.

Finally, I started settling for programmatic way to control the mouse! So, for
this, I have already seen some github repos long ago. I can only remember this
one now - https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick . It's written objective C though,
which seems more scarier than swift for me ðŸ˜† Anyways, it works though. I
remember using it a long time ago. I wanted to simply check if moving the
mouse was possible in swift. I mean, it must be possible is what I though,
just had to find out how. I finally found these links

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/1455258-cgdisplaymovecursortopoint
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/quartz_display_services

And I started writing code to check if it works. This is the demo app I have
[here](https://github.com/karuppiah7890/demo-mac-app) which has moving cursor
feature ;) :D

I could do it with these links:

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgdirectdisplayid
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/quartz_display_services#1655882
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/1455620-cgmaindisplayid
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgpoint

and then this article 

https://medium.com/@sergueivinnitskii/easy-struct-initialization-in-swift-8ee46b8d84d5

teching how to initialize a struct ðŸ™ˆ I really need to learn meself some Swift!
ðŸ˜† 

Anyways, it works now. I was able to move the mouse! Yay! :D :D ;)
