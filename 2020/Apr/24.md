So, I'm trying out 
https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger 
since it seems to have some more
features with regards to mentioning
what are the required fields in a
struct which I don't think is not
present in https://github.com/swaggo/swag
or it doesn't seem to be documented
and also be able to give
examples in comments and not in struct
tags

learning - a feature not documented
is a feature which does not exist
for the user

```
$ swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json
```

Now it generates

```
$ cat swagger.json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "paths": {}
}
```

it takes quite some time for it to
generate this actually. haha

```
$ swagger2openapi swagger.json
S2OError: (Patchable) info object is mandatory

    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterClose [as oncomplete] (internal/fs/read_file_context.js:61:3) {
  name: 'S2OError'
}
```

I need to add some required fields now.
For example name, version and license.
Let me do just that

I add some code comments and was always 
running this

```
$ swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json
```

and it never changed anything in the json
file. And then I thought may be it's not
looking at the right files like, in our
case there's no main.go and only App.go
exists. So I did this then

```
$ swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json -i App.go
analyzed: yaml: line 3: mapping values are not allowed in this context
```

and I keep getting that error whatever I do.

In one of our apis, we have a query param
which takes input like this -

```
<host>/v1/endpoint?q=1,2,3,4
```

I need to check how to define this parameter.
Is it an array of numbers, or strings,
or just a string :P Actually in our case,
it could also be

```
<host>/v1/endpoint?q=jkl,ghi,ef,abcd
```

Was checking this for the same:
