So, I'm trying out 
https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger 
since it seems to have some more
features with regards to mentioning
what are the required fields in a
struct which I don't think is not
present in https://github.com/swaggo/swag
or it doesn't seem to be documented
and also be able to give
examples in comments and not in struct
tags

learning - a feature not documented
is a feature which does not exist
for the user

```
$ swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json
```

Now it generates

```
$ cat swagger.json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "paths": {}
}
```

it takes quite some time for it to
generate this actually. haha

```
$ swagger2openapi swagger.json
S2OError: (Patchable) info object is mandatory

    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterClose [as oncomplete] (internal/fs/read_file_context.js:61:3) {
  name: 'S2OError'
}
```

I need to add some required fields now.
For example name, version and license.
Let me do just that

I add some code comments and was always 
running this

```
$ swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json
```

and it never changed anything in the json
file. And then I thought may be it's not
looking at the right files like, in our
case there's no main.go and only App.go
exists. So I did this then

```
$ swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json -i App.go
analyzed: yaml: line 3: mapping values are not allowed in this context
```

and I keep getting that error whatever I do.

In one of our apis, we have a query param
which takes input like this -

```
<host>/v1/endpoint?q=1,2,3,4
```

I need to check how to define this parameter.
Is it an array of numbers, or strings,
or just a string :P Actually in our case,
it could also be

```
<host>/v1/endpoint?q=jkl,ghi,ef,abcd
```

Was checking this for the same:

So I haven't worked on Android codebases
as part of a company project before. I have
worked on Android though. As part of side
projects and all :P And this was long ago.
Anyways. So, today I'm setting up my local
with all the stuff needed to run the Android
App in my local

So I got android studio from here for my
Mac

https://developer.android.com/studio

I got version `3.6.3`. After installing,
I opened it up. Used the dark theme,
let it download some stuff. And then
opened up my project. And then it told me
it need 2GB heap memory, so gave that
in settings and restarted stuff. Also,
updated my firebase plugin. And then I
wanted to run the app in my emulator so
I download the missing image for my
emulator. It had chosen Pixel 3 XL API29
for the build. It downloaded the necessary
OS image I think and now I'm running the 
build which is taking a LONG time. I think 
this could be done in a better manner. Hmm.
I mean, first time build is fine. But I don't
want every build of mine taking so much time.
May be use Bazel or something and make use
of cache. Like, I have been waiting for ages
for the build now :P

In the mean time, I setup the `PATH` environment variable
to run tools like `adb` in my local like this

```
export PATH="~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/:$PATH"
```

I use mac, hence the above.

Wow. The build succeeded. It took 11 mins!

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 11m 17s
641 actionable tasks: 641 executed
```

but the app works in my machine! :D Yay!
I didn't have to do anything cool or stuff.
I do have to check how to point the
app to the backend service based on the
environment - like Dev, QA, Prod.
