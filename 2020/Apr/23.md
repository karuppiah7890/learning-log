So, I've to solve two problems at hand -
1. Generate Open API spec from annotated code / commented code
2. An easy way to create Open API spec from scratch - visually,
without typing much.

For now I'm working on the first one. I'm able to check that
there are many tools to create swagger spec from commented code 
and then some tools to convert swagger spec to open api spec.

I don't think I checked for any tools that directly generate
open api spec from commented code. Let me check for that!

Okay, I can see quite some cool projects here!

https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md

The spec itself is here - https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification
and here in the site http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3

I think I could create a golang implementation too :P And then submit
here

https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3implementations-form

or in this repo https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification by
creating an issue :P ;)

I can't seem to find openapi spec generation from commented code.
Checking back here

https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=openapi

By the way, this IntelliJ IDEA plugin for spec writing looks really cool -

https://github.com/zalando/intellij-swagger

So, with the generated swagger.json and swagger.yaml , I'm able to validate
the swagger spec using

```
$ swagger validate swagger.json
```

So, these are the errors I currently get -

```
$ swagger validate swagger.json

The swagger spec at "swagger.json" is invalid against swagger specification 2.0.
See errors below:
- info.license.name in body is required
- info.version in body is required
- info.title in body is required
```

And without fixing these, I used `swagger2openapi` and this is what I got

```
$ npm install -g swagger2openapi
$ swagger2openapi swagger.json
S2OError: (Patchable) info.title cannot be null

    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterClose [as oncomplete] (internal/fs/read_file_context.js:61:3) {
  name: 'S2OError'
}
```

Finally, after adding the title, version and the license name in the code
using this 

```
// @title ABC Service
// @version 1.0

// @license.name Close Source
```


and then generating spec and then converting worked.

Now, I need to check what are the features that I'm expecting from the tool
that is generating the swagger spec. Expected features -

1. I should be able to give a summary and / description of the endpoint
2. Tell the content types it accepts and produces / responds with. Eg application/json
3. Request method. Eg GET, POST
4. Request path. Eg /users/
5. Parameters in request path. Eg /users/{userId}/info
6. Definition of each parameter and if it is
present in request path or query params
7. Type / Schema of the request - the whole
request body structure
8. Different possible response code and the
type / schema of the responses
9. Summary, description and example for
almost everything
10. Mention if something is required -
like some parameter/field/header
11. Mention the headers of a request/
response

https://github.com/swaggo/swag seems to
have some good features and it's very
very simple. But I need some flexibility
sometimes. For example - the ability to
be able to tell some fields in a request
body are not mandatory and some are
mandatory. I can't seem to find how
tell the required fields in this case. 
They do have a way to tell that the
wholoe of the request body is required.
One more thing to note is, in this tool,
the examples are written as struct tags.
I was expecting some kind of comments


https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger
seems good. https://goswagger.io/ docs
are cool. Looks like it has lots of
features! :) I'm planning to use it and
see how it goes

I installed it from source. Tried this
first

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger
```

and it didn't work. Then I cloned and
tried

```
$ git clone github.com:go-swagger/go-swagger
$ cd go-swagger/GOMODULE=off go install -v ./cmd/swagger/
$ swagger version
dev
```

I was not really so much into the
binary installation that's why installed
from source

First we must read the stuff here -
https://goswagger.io/generate/spec.html

Now I need write docs for some routes -
https://goswagger.io/use/spec/route.html

and then operations, parameters

https://goswagger.io/use/spec/operation.html
https://goswagger.io/use/spec/params.html
