# April 20th 2020

So, we are having this problem in QA environment, where there
are users that have been created for automation tests. And
the data setup for the tests are done once. And then the
automation tests are run continuously. But the problem
is that some people unintentinally are changing the
data of these automation test users, for example
name, or any data. And that causes the automation
tests to fail.

I'm trying to use https://github.com/swaggo/swag . When
installing with 

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag
```

it failed with some error saying `urfave/cli` version `v2`
is not present or something. I think there's some issue
in their go.mod or something? Idk. Hmm. For now going to
install by using the binary directly from releases page.
I got the tar ball and opened it with my OS's extractor
which kicks in when I double click the tar ball. 

```
$ mv ~/Downloads/swag_1.6.5_Darwin_x86_64/swag /usr/local/bin/
```

Now we have `swag`. 

```
$ swag
Killed: 9
```

So, macos catalina asked if it should put the `swag` binary in trash
as it's from an unknown developer. I had to use this

```
$ sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/swag
```

And now it all works

```
$ swag
NAME:
   swag - Automatically generate RESTful API documentation with Swagger 2.0 for Go.

USAGE:
   swag [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   v1.6.5

COMMANDS:
   init, i  Create docs.go
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h     show help
   --version, -v  print the version

$ swag -v
swag version v1.6.5
```

Okay, I tried this

```
$ swag init
2020/04/20 08:24:02 Generate swagger docs....
2020/04/20 08:24:02 Generate general API Info, search dir:./
2020/04/20 08:24:02 cannot parse source files /Users/karuppiahn/mapan/social-app/content_service/main.go: open /Users/karuppiahn/mapan/social-app/content_service/main.go: no such file or directory
```

It's looking for `main.go`. We use `App.go` as our entry point. Let's see how to use that

```
$ swag init -h
NAME:
   swag init - Create docs.go

USAGE:
   swag init [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --generalInfo value, -g value       Go file path in which 'swagger general API Info' is written (default: "main.go")
   --dir value, -d value               Directory you want to parse (default: "./")
   --propertyStrategy value, -p value  Property Naming Strategy like snakecase,camelcase,pascalcase (default: "camelcase")
   --output value, -o value            Output directory for all the generated files(swagger.json, swagger.yaml and doc.go) (default: "./docs")
   --parseVendor                       Parse go files in 'vendor' folder, disabled by default
   --parseDependency                   Parse go files in outside dependency folder, disabled by default
   --markdownFiles value, --md value   Parse folder containing markdown files to use as description, disabled by default
   --generatedTime                     Generate timestamp at the top of docs.go, true by default

```

Okay, so we need to change `--generalInfo` flag

```
$ swag init --generalInfo App.go
2020/04/20 08:26:09 Generate swagger docs....
2020/04/20 08:26:09 Generate general API Info, search dir:./
2020/04/20 08:26:09 create docs.go at  docs/docs.go
2020/04/20 08:26:09 create swagger.json at  docs/swagger.json
2020/04/20 08:26:09 create swagger.yaml at  docs/swagger.yaml
```

So I found the json and yaml files to be empty. Of course, because I didn't do anything
to give input. Next I added to one of the APIs. It was a POST endpoint. The example
I used was this

```
// ShowAccount godoc
// @Summary Show a account
// @Description get string by ID
// @ID get-string-by-int
// @Accept  json
// @Produce  json
// @Param id path int true "Account ID"
// @Success 200 {object} model.Account
// @Header 200 {string} Token "qwerty"
// @Failure 400 {object} httputil.HTTPError
// @Failure 404 {object} httputil.HTTPError
// @Failure 500 {object} httputil.HTTPError
// @Router /accounts/{id} [get]
```

And modified it and it worked after some iterations. Now I'm checking how to
convert swagger json/yaml to open api yaml. Specifically, swagger 2.0 to
open api 3.0 is the target

While looking for this, these are the stuff I skimmed through
