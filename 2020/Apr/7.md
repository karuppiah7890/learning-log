# April 7th 2020

So, today during work, we faced this one issue, where a telegraf instance was not
able to push metrics to influxdb and we had to debug what's the issue

The logs said something about some timeout and gave a url that was used for the
post request

I had no idea about influxdb except that it can store time series and people push
metrics to it - push model.

To debug, we wanted to first check if the influxdb url is reachable and if the
db instance exists. These are the things that we did to check that

```
$ dig <the-influx-url>
$ dig +short <the-influx-url>

$ # the port used was 8086, so
$ telnet <ip-from-above-output> 8086

```

And then since we noticed that influxdb uses some http interface, we started checking
it's API and also tried ping curl already

```
$ curl -i <the-influxdb-url>/ping
```

Now, we started searching the API docs page. These are the links

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=influxdb+push+metric+with+curl

https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/guides/writing_data/

The first doubt I had was - what version are we using? So that we can see
the appropriate docs. Luckily the ping endpoint tells the influxdb version,
so we found out it's 1.7.2 and started seeing the docs then

We wanted to first check if the database is present or not, for this we
planned to list databases or something similar

https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/
https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/#query-http-endpoint

We then found out that the below is the curl for it through a stackoverflow
answer

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34156798/how-to-get-databases-list-at-influxdb-in-v0-8#43472938

```
$ curl -G "http://somehost:8086/query?pretty=true" --data-urlencode "q=show databases"
```

initially I had removed the `-G` as I didn't know what it was, but without that it didn't
work. I checked the manual for curl then, didn't understand too much but understood that
it's used along with `--data-urlencode`, anyways, the curl worked and we found out that the
db instance that we wanted exists! :)

We wanted to push a metric and check if it works. We planned to just push
one dummy metric - the environment was staging, so, we were okay with it.
This is the sample curl we got

```
$ curl -i -XPOST 'http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb' --data-binary 'cpu_load_short,host=server01,region=us-west value=0.64 1434055562000000000'
```

Now, we changed this to

```
$ curl -i -XPOST 'http://<the-infuxdb-url>:8086/write?consistency=any&db=<db-name>' --data-binary 'my_dummy_counter,something=somevalue value=10'
```

We got the consistency parameter and the db value from the error logs. And we didn't
put timestamp value in it as it's optional

https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#timestamp
https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/

And the above curl just worked. So, we kind of felt that it works now. May be we will come
back to the issue if it occurs again! :)
