# free ebooks stuff 1 :P

So, I always get the free ebooks. :P :P no matter I read them or not. I
usually hardly read them 😅 🙈 But I still get em. So, today I got a kong
one

https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Security-in-a-Multi-Cloud-World.pdf

It's about security in a multi cloud world :)

A web page on the same - 

https://konghq.com/ebooks/Security-in-a-Multi-Cloud-World

I just got curious if there are other ebooks, probably, over here

https://konghq.com/ebooks/

and there are! Like many! Maybe I'll get them later sometime, lazy now
😴

I actually have tons of free ebooks I got like this, in my google drive
😅 Anyways, it's fun to get free content. But may be if I pay, I could
value it. But funnily, I also have lots of books that I'm yet to read,
but again, I kind of got it for free - company paid for it. I'm
starting to create a reading habit. I think some day it will get
better and I'll start reading more :)

# talks stuff 1

So, I'm planning to give a talk today to my colleagues in office. A
short talk on plugin systems in general? 🤔 and then show how I created
a kafka plugin?

But I don't know how plugins exactly work. In terraform, in our
internal tools, I have seen how plugins usually are separate binaries
than the core software. I think there's some RPC calls - remote
procedure calls. Or may be something else. 

But if I don't know this, I don't know how I can manage. May be I can
see the different plugins I have used and then show about the kong
plugin.

Some examples that I know are - CLI tool plugins (like git, kubectl,
docker, helm etc) , software plugins - kong, internal tools, terraform,
I don't know anything else yet.

May be if I read this today, I could do the talk ;) Let's see, hmm :)

And I'll need some good and simple presentations for the talk to convey
the message. I'll have to prepare that too! 😅 🙈 Let's see how it goes!

Okay, so I didn't read the stuff that I said I would. I just went ahead
and sent an invite for the short talk that I planned and I did it
impromptu! Even with the little stuff that I had to say, I took some
35 mins! This is including a minute or so of Q and A. Anyways, it was a
good experience. I mean, I just went in and told what I know and what I
did with kong plugins. 

One thing to note is - I didn't have any slides for the presentation 😅
I just opened sublime text and wrote stuff that I said. Sometimes I told
lots of stuff and then wrote it down, and I was reading it out loud
while writing 😅 which made it look like saying it again. But I got
feedback that it was awesome and that it looked good for a short talk.

So, why did I do it? So, by now you know that I'm very comfortable
typing a lot. And even while working, I write down the tasks to be done
and things to note and stuff like that. And any assumptions etc too.
I usually forget stuff, and I also find it easy to write down what I
think and do, it just helps me connect things, and also keeps work a
bit focussed too. :)

One more thing I can think of is - if I write down whatever I say, at
some point I'll say things in a concise manner so I can tell it easily,
or I might write it in a concise manner or just the keywords. And I
think it would help the listeners as usually people tend to like to see
something (I like to 🤷‍♂) like the speaker, or the slide or something.
So, I thought I'll just show them what I'm talking about. And I was
also talking really fast, so I guess the words in the text editor
guided them on the way :)

Below is the content that I said

# plugin systems and how I created a kong plugin

Plugin Systems and How I created a Kong plugin

Have you all used plugins?

Any plugins

example - git plugins, like git-open

What? Why?
Plugins / Extensions - extending features / customizing features of the core software

Working - depends on the core

Core and plugin are separate binaries. Some kind of interaction or communication

Core and plugins are kept as separate source code. And it's possible to have some default plugins

kubectl plugins
docker plugins
Terraform providers are plugins

command line tools and plugins -

different binaries. communication is through invocation of binary, client-server model with
rpc (grpc, message pack rpc)

Do server software have plugins?

I write some webapp, is it possible for me to extend or provide extensions, such that
other people can use it?

GitHub - employee. I want to help people extend it.

What do I do?

webhooks

I'll give an example

Let's say I want to provide access to all the things happening in the github repo, so that
CI/CD systems can do the builds

webhook (plugins/extensions)

Hey, CI/CD systems, I can actually make a http call, to some endpoint, with some data based
on a spec that I define, and if you conform to it, that is if you understand the data I send,
you can integrate with me

travis - CI/CD

in my github repo settings, config - webhook, what kind? push webhook

whenever there's a push event (commit), github web app will do a http call to an endpoint with data
regarding the push event

travis - okay, I'll expose an endpoint on my side, with authentication, and whenever there's a
request sent to it, I'll trigger my build

commit -> ci/cd builds

instead of polling - intervals. you can work on push.

this is an example of multiple webapps talking

other examples for plugins - browser plugins

Recently, kong plugins

Kong - API gateway

lua, nginx

One gateway (mutiple instances) for all your APIs

Why?

Authentication, Rate limiting

Kong plugins

lua modules - plugin

Kong will just call your plugin functions

when? what is the data that your plugin?

Plugins consist of Lua modules interacting with the request/response objects or streams via the Plugin Development Kit (or “PDK”) to implement arbitrary logic. The PDK is a set of Lua functions that a plugin can use to facilitate interactions between plugins and the core (or other components) of Kong.

Kong API gateway - HTTP v1 and v2 (grpc). request and response in http

Authentication and Authz

request - read from it, and say if some request is auth / authz or not ?

plugin - when should it be called?

call the plugin when request comes in
call the plugin when the response from api comes in
different events in the lifecycle

authentication and authz

when request comes in call plugin

Plugin Development Kit (or “PDK”) - lua. golang

lua modules

golang - rpc model. plugin server and kong core. plugin server calls your plugin code

plugin development kit - pdk (lua and golang) - functions and methods, variables to help you interact
with kong

request body of the http request - message for kafka in test topic

# talks stuff 2

As you can see, the content is very raw. I also tweaked it a bit after
the talk to accomodate some extra content - like references and stuff
that I showed during the talk, in my browser :)

# open source stuff 1

One more repo that I just opened up during my plugins talk was

https://github.com/doujiang24/lua-resty-kafka

So, this is the lua library used by the enterprise kafka upstream
plugin, for interacting with kafka. May be I could check their
code and see the configurations they provide and how it maps with the
configs in the library we use, which in our case is shopify/sarama
currently :)

# twitter stuff

So, I scroll twitter a lot. Like a LOT these days 🙈 😅 and it's a really
good source of information for me. I see a lot of things in it.
Sometimes I do get overwhelmed by it 😅 like FOMO and stuff. Anyways,
some cool stuff that I noticed is

# twitter stuff 1
opentelemetry - 
https://opentelemetry.io/

I saw a tweet about the opentelemetry sig group for php.

https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#php-sig

the repo:
https://github.com/open-telemetry/community

I have heard about opentelemetry before, but never got around to using
it :/ I mean, there are tons of software that I have in my list to try.
I'm gonna have to really manage my time if I really want to try all the
getting started guides of all those stuff in my list 😆 🙈

# twitter stuff 2

another cool thing that I saw is this tweet about Falco

https://twitter.com/krisnova/status/1217633654911856642?s=20

I have seen about this too. Just seen / heard. Never used it. Again.
Hmm 🙈 Some more links

https://falco.org/

They call it the runtime security. I need to use it to understand it 😅
I mean, I'm also not a big security guy, so there will be some eye
openers I guess!

I think falco is by sysdig 

https://sysdig.com

Check more about their open source stuff here 

https://sysdig.com/opensource

# twitter stuff 3

I saw a tweet about this tool called `tbls`

https://twitter.com/PostgresWeekly/status/1217744300676722688?s=20

https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls

Apparently it's used to document databases! I was wondering what it
exactly meant and then I saw this - 

https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls/blob/master/sample/doc.png

It looks really cool ;) I think I'll try it out sometime :D

# book stuff 1

So, I read very little of the "Start with Why" book today. Now it's
kind of getting boring :P I mean, I'm still seeing a lot of the same
stuff. But this time it was about dates and business - how even in
business deals, see if the other party believes in what you believe and
the likes. I think it's more of - check if they have a why, see if
their why matches with yours. This also spoke about resumes. I think
the next time I write my resume, I will write why I do software
development and stuff like what I believe in - with respect to software
and see before hand if the company has a why and if it aligns with my
why. I think it's not gonna be very easy 🙈

Also, I noticed that I'm reading the book very slowly. But I think one
good thing is - I'm seeing how I can apply it in my life. Also, I'm
having this weird feeling while reading this book - I read it, and then
forget it 🙈 like, I think I need to have some key take aways. But yeah,
I'm the kind of guy who feels remembering stuff is not key. It's just
that I still beat myself about it. Have to try and stop it 😅 May be I
should start telling myself what I tell others about remembering stuff,
which is - remembering stuff is not key, as a cheap flash drive can
remember stuff - knowledge, data, experience, etc, but a brain can do
much more than that - like creativity and what not. It does make sense.
I think I should just follow it more and not beat myself up when I
forget stuff. 

Also, this is really true. Use docs, logs, todo lists and what not to
remember stuff. I think I'll write a blog around this 🤔 There's only
so much I can remember sometimes. I do beat myself up for forgetting
people's names and then finally recalling it 😅 Anyways, that's a deep
topic to be discussed later. Not now
