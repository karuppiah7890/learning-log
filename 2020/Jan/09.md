# Day Job Stuff 1

So today too I worked on the Helm Chart. And I learned what permissions
are needed to approve certificate signing requests, to create them,
and a bit about permissions regarding mutating admission webhooks,
secrets

I also used this cool stack overflow article to help with my work

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47770676/how-to-create-a-kubectl-config-file-for-serviceaccount/47776588#47776588

It shows how you can create a kube config file using service account
details, so that you can use kubectl. This is useful when you want to
run kubectl inside your containers and using service accounts for
authentication and authorization

For authorization, use rbac - role, rolebinding, cluster role, cluster
rolebinding. Here's a good video on the same

Using rbac concepts, you can provide access to your service account to
do different things :)

# Book Stuff 1

I'm still reading the "Start with Why" book. I'm a slow reader ðŸ˜…
So, while I'm reading this book, it makes me wonder about things like,
why do I even go to work? why do I spend 8+ hrs a day in my office?
why travel hours to go to work? 

All this when the author asks why we wake up in the morning everyday?
I think it's essential to think about the whys, and make sure you know
why. I'm still trying to figure out the why ðŸ˜… But I think I'll get
there. Hopefully I'll be in a better place once I really understand the
whys :)
