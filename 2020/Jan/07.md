## Open Source Stuff 1

So my Buoyant call didn't happen. The person I was supposed to talk to
fell sick, so I moved it to a Friday morning 6 am call. And here I'm
sitting in front of my computer at 6:15 am 😅

Anyways, now, let's get back to our Kong stuff. Before that.

Some new possibilities (opportunities) created based on yesterday's
and day before yesterday's learnings is kind of obvious I think. I
had some ideas for project(s)? Nothing much

Also, now that I'm getting a bit of a hang of Kong plugins, I'm
wondering if I can create plugins and may be create a business out of
it ;) :D Let's see :)

Now, we were able to run the plugin I had created and see how it sent
200 OK response with a response body, in JSON that too. 

Now, I have been doing too much Docker and all. I'm planning to just
run Kong in local to make my life easier. I might have to find a better
way to do plugin development. But surely this - build plugin in docker
container, copy it to docker container, run plugin server in docker
container, run kong in docker container. And doing execs a lot of
times, it's all too much. 

So, I spent some time checking out how to install the v2 rc1 version
in my mac. I'm using the ever slow brew :P And did this

```
$ brew tap kong/kong
$ brew install --devel kong
```

But it just kept failing. Only later I realized that usually Kong needs
a dependency - openresty

https://github.com/Kong/homebrew-kong/blob/master/Formula/kong.rb#L12

But in development version, they aren't putting that usually, not sure
why. 

https://github.com/Kong/homebrew-kong/blob/master/Formula/kong.rb#L6

I think they are guessing that people would have already installed
openresty using the released version? Or may be if they want to change
the openresty version, they won't? But brew can take care of different
versions 🤔 anyways, I'll put that as an issue and ask that question I
guess

Now I've done this to install it

```
$ brew install kong/kong/openresty@1.15.8.2
```

I had some linking errors for luarocks and stuff. I think I already had
it installed, but I didn't care and just overwrote the links using

```
$ brew link --overwrite openresty
```

and then installing kong now with

```
$ brew install --devel kong
```

In the meanwhile, I'm going to check some of my issues and PRs ;)

First one being https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/449 . It's the
helm docs

I have to rebase. Been pending for some days now 🙈

Oooh. Kong is installed. Let me just check version and then do the PR!

```
$ kong version
2.0.0rc1
```

Awesome! :D

Now, the docs PR! 

Finished the rebase and pushed it :)

Now, back to Kong. Now, I need to learn how to run Kong locally. I
guess, it's just about creating a config file and then doing
`kong start`.

Okay wait, I have one issue to respond to before checking all that.
Which is this - https://github.com/Kong/go-pdk/issues/16

So, Guilherme has told that they welcome PRs :D so, now, I need to
check what he's talking about when he says serialization and
deserialization. I mean, what kind? I have done that before for JSON,
YAML. I have to see what it means here, and may be why it's needed,
considering others didn't require anything in the file I saw. But he
does say that only some need it. I'm thinking about if `exit` method
needs it or not. Lua was good enough to work on the happy path - the
`nil`, the `object` (`map` in golang), I didn't try string or any
other type. Actually other types should fail, string will pass. That
should be the way it works, seeing the lua code. Let's see if that's
the case, by running everything in local ;) :D

Now, I need a DB. I'm going to use the postgres app 
https://postgresapp.com/

I'll run a postgres 12 I think. Or may be I'll first check what's
supported, cuz in docker I was running 9.6 version!

Okay, according to this -

https://docs.konghq.com/install/macos/

It says Kong supports postgres 9.5+

Also, I know that there's a feature where you can use Kong without a
DB 🤔 may be I could try that? As it's Kong that I'm working with, and
this is not production. I'm good with a file I guess. Let's stick to
the file. Phew. I should have actually done this before. Lesser
components makes things easier :)

Let's just make this work! :)

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/kong
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kong/kong/master/kong.conf.default -o kong.conf.default
$ sudo cp kong.conf.default /etc/kong/kong.conf
```

And then I changed the configuration


And started kong!

```
$ kong start
```

It gave some warning about `ulimit -n` being less. 

```
2020/01/07 07:10:13 [warn] ulimit is currently set to "2048". For better performance set it to at least "4096" using "ulimit -n"
```

I think it's about the number of open connections that I can have? 
It was saying the value is `256` and that it's less, and asking to
keep it more for better performance. I actually cleared my screen
before I read completely 🙈 I started kong again after stopping
to see the message. I guess this is fine. Also, I set it to
`2048` that's why the above new error message say that as the
value and not `256`. Ignoring that, I tried `curl` for proxy
and admin port

```
$ curl localhost:8000
{"message":"no Route matched with those values"}
```

```
$ curl localhost:8001

```

and it worked :D

Next, I gotta start doing golang plugin stuff, like run golang plugin
server and then also change my config for golang plugins directory,
and then add my golang plugins to the list of plugins, and then I
also need to check if the socket issues are present here too. 
Remember I used to do `chmod` and change socket file permissions
after running golang plugin server? Let's see if that comes up
again :)

For now, I'm gonna start to office and then continue there I guess,
till I start off my day job at around 10:15 am

# Open Source Stuff 2

Okay, at office and done with breakfast. Just a few more minutes for my
standup. While travelling to work, I checked out some stuff about
rust language. Yeah, well, I have been thinking about trying out rust
for a long time now.

The last time I tried, I was feeling pretty dumb and was scared to even
try things. People spoke about multiple books 

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/foreword.html

https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Covers-2018/dp/1718500440

So, now, I'm back to thinking about trying out rust lang. This is for
the same reasons as before - many people are telling rust lang is cool,
well, people tell the same thing for clojure, kotlin, haskell, elixir,
golang (oh, I know a bit of this one :)), and many more.

But for some reason rust has been the talk of the hour a lot of the
times. May be it's just my circles :P meh

Anyways, now that I'm planning to get back to rust, this time I'm
planning to go more goal oriented. This time I'm going to try what I
tell other people to try and what a lot of people have told - learning
a programming language by contributing to open source

So, I chose Linkerd project. https://linkerd.io/ - A service mesh

The linkerd2 proxy is written in rust language - 

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy

Here's a link to learn a bit about service mesh - 
https://servicemesh.io/

But it might be a bit biased? lol. As it's written by the creators of
linkerd, which is just one service mesh out there :)

Anyways, I started checking some issues. Looks like the issues for
the linkerd2 proxy are in this repo -

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2

over here

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues using the label `area/proxy`

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fproxy

And I usually try to checkout bugs. So here's what I checked

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fproxy+label%3Abug

I will surely work on the proxy, and might check bugs first, or else
go ahead with the other issues, which seems to be a lot in number :)

I just decided that I'll work on Linkerd, didn't do anything else
though. Actually, I had this in mind before too, but more on the golang
side of things of the linkerd project which is this repo 

https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2 which is in golang

Also, one more thing - So I have decided to have a habit to checkout
rust and linkerd stuff for like 10-20 mins max. And learn stuff in that
time. Let's see how it goes :)

I want to do the same for books! :) 10-20 mins max of book reading
everyday.

Trying to create a habit

# Blog stuff

I recently read some blog posts. I haven't shared it to many people I think.
This was a good read - 

`What Happens When Your Career Becomes Your Whole Identity`

https://hbr.org/2019/12/what-happens-when-your-career-becomes-your-whole-identity

It made me think about what else defines me 😅Quite a life changing blog post!

While posting this link, I just noticed that they have a topic / tag
called `Work-Life Balance` ! Neat !

https://hbr.org/topic/work-life-balance

May be that's a good read for the future!

# Book stuff

Like I mentioned, I'm planning to read a bit everyday, like 10-20 mins.
I did that today :) I read "Start With Why" and in that I read about
promotions and fear, in the context of businesses. Now that I think of
it, I have to go back and check the chapter I'm in, lololol. :P

What I read and understood - so, it spoke about how promotions
sometimes give us a small nudge to buy one product compared to the
other, and that it comes at a cost for the business. And it also
spoke about how fear is used to push us to buy things, even though the
fear cannot kill, it can push us.

It made a lot of sense actually. But promotions stuff - I already knew.
But I must agree that I still fall for it 🙈 😅 especially cashback
offers!

# Open Source Stuff 3

Back to Kong now! I'm just going to try a few things now.

One is, check what happens when I pass a number to the response body
for exit function. Let's do that first

This is how I'm changing the method that I have in my kafka plugin

```
func (conf *PluginConfig) Access (kong *pdk.PDK) {
	err := kong.Response.Exit(200, 10, nil)
	if err != nil {
		_ = kong.Log.Err(err.Error())
	}
}
```

Let's build it!

```
$ make
```

Now, let's build our golang plugin server and run it!

```
$ cd go-pluginserver
$ make
```

Now I went and changed the `kong.conf` to this

```
prefix = /Users/karuppiahn/kong/
```

after this

```
$ mkdir -p ~/kong
```

Okay, lol. I changed a copy of the conf file. I think I should delete
the `/etc/kong/kong.conf` or even `/etc/kong` and go ahead with local
files that I have :)

Same thing for kong prefix configuration. If you see above, I'm
changing the default `/usr/local/kong` to the above home directory in
my machine! :)

Now, let's do all this and run Kong :D

okay, actually, one more thing is needed. The golang plugins directory!
I'll create this too, and then put my kafka plugin in it, change kong
config accordingly and then start it!

In the mean time, I have already built `go-pluginserver` and started
it!

```
./go-pluginserver -socket /Users/karuppiahn/kong/go_pluginserver.sock
```

Now, golang plugins directory!

```
$ mkdir -p ~/kong-golang-plugins-dir
```

Next, in config

```
...
go_plugins_dir = /Users/karuppiahn/kong-golang-plugins-dir
...
```

The funny part was that, in the v2 rc1 version, when we do
`kong config init` it doesn't put any default config or any information
about the golang plugins directory! I'm not sure why. This issue needs
to be raised!

Started it off!

```
$ kong start -c kong.conf

2020/01/07 21:28:41 [warn] ulimit is currently set to "2048". For better performance set it to at least "4096" using "ulimit -n"
Kong started
```

Phew! Now I need to enable the plugin! Let's use the enterprise plugin
example! :D :D

```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/routes \
     --data "name=kafka-upstream" \
     --data "hosts[]=kafka-upstream.dev"

{"name":"operation unsupported","message":"cannot create 'routes' entities when not using a database","code":12}
```

Ouch. When there's no database, that's what you get. That what happens.
To you. 🤦‍♂ Now, let me do the same in the config file of kong!

Okay, so with some assumption I put this

```
routes:
- name: kafka-upstream
  # Relationships can also be specified between top-level entities,
  # either by name or by id
  hosts: ["kafka-upstream.dev"]
  plugins:
  - kafka-upstream
```

even though I saw some example on the top for some other resource
and one for routes too. Routes one didn't have plugins though

And then while running, I see this!

```
$ kong restart -c kong.conf
2020/01/07 21:35:44 [warn] ulimit is currently set to "2048". For better performance set it to at least "4096" using "ulimit -n"

  Run with --v (verbose) or --vv (debug) for more details
```

After some time I realized that the plugins array is not just an array
of strings. It's an array of plugin objects. I think the plugin object
has configs too? other than the name. Hence the object? I guess so. 
Anyways, I'll come back to that! Let me fix it now!

```
$ kong restart -c kong.conf
2020/01/07 21:37:46 [warn] ulimit is currently set to "2048". For better performance set it to at least "4096" using "ulimit -n"
Kong started
```

Woohoo! Also, I just realized I'm in zombie mode. My writing is helping
me a bit to remember stuff, lol 😆 😝

Now, let's get this done with !

One request for now!

```
$  curl http://localhost:8000 --header 'Host: kafka-upstream.dev'
{"message":"no Route matched with those values"}
```

Ouch! Let's see what mistake we did!

Okay, may be I should get some sleep 🤔I put the wrong plugin name in
the routes. But no error came up 🤔 also Kong is telling stuff like
there's no match. Hmm. Weird. I gotta dig further!

Should have checked the routes list first

```
$ curl localhost:8001/routes
{"next":null,"data":[{"strip_path":true,"path_handling":"v0","paths":null,"destinations":null,"headers":null,"protocols":["http","https"],"created_at":1578413266,"snis":null,"hosts":["kafka-upstream.dev"],"name":"kafka-upstream","service":null,"preserve_host":false,"regex_priority":0,"tags":null,"sources":null,"id":"0c526b08-ede8-5178-bef7-1e59d3503ae8","https_redirect_status_code":426,"updated_at":1578413266,"methods":null}]}
```

Hmm, let's check the plugins now for the route

```
$ curl localhost:8001/routes/kafka-upstream/plugins
{"next":null,"data":[{"created_at":1578413266,"consumer":null,"id":"c7f72f4c-41e2-51d0-ae7a-b353c6fe1e29","service":null,"enabled":true,"tags":null,"name":"kafka-upstream","protocols":["grpc","grpcs","http","https"],"route":{"id":"0c526b08-ede8-5178-bef7-1e59d3503ae8"}}]}
```

Lol. Right. The name is supposed to be `kafka-upstream-golang` as the
`.so` is `kafka-upstream-golang.so`. Hmm. Let me fix that and see if it
works!

```
$ kong restart -c kong.conf
Kong stopped
2020/01/07 21:44:24 [warn] ulimit is currently set to "2048". For better performance set it to at least "4096" using "ulimit -n"
Kong started
```

```
$ curl http://localhost:8000 --header 'Host: kafka-upstream.dev'
{"message":"no Route matched with those values"}
```

Damn. Same error!

This is weird 🤔 Hmm. Let me try the same thing with the working plugin.
Since the current change I made - it's not a correct one, and that's
what I expect, as according to the lua code I saw, body can be nil,
string or a map (object). Let's fix our plugin code and get back to
this again!

I built the plugin, retarted plugin server, reloaded kong

```
$ make
$ cp kafka-upstream-golang.so ~/kong-golang-plugins-dir/
```

```
$ ./go-pluginserver -socket /Users/karuppiahn/kong/go_pluginserver.sock
```

```
$ kong reload -c kong.conf
```

Nope. Still the same thing. Hmm

```
$ curl -H 'Host: kafka-upstream.dev' http://localhost:8000
{"message":"no Route matched with those values"} 
```

I think I'll sleep on it and then see what's the issue. 

Okay, wait. What. So. I stopped kong. And then tried the curl

```
$ kong stop
Kong stopped

$ curl -H 'Host: kafka-upstream.dev' http://localhost:8000
{"message":"you are da best! :D"}
```

And this comes? really? I have to see what I messed up 🤔 😆

Apparently that shouldn't have stopped kong. I tried to stop again and
got errors and then I did this

```
$ kong stop -p /Users/karuppiahn/kong

$ curl -H 'Host: kafka-upstream.dev' http://localhost:8000
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000: Connection refused
```

Hmm. Not sure how it stopped before. Something fishy. I think I messed
up something being sleepy. Okay, I should sleep. Night 😴

Okay, I went ahead and tried it all again. It looks fine now. 🤔

Started server, stopped and checked stuff. So, with int, I get this
for the curl

```
$ curl -H 'Host: kafka-upstream.dev' http://localhost:8000
{"message":"An unexpected error occurred"} 
```

And I can see a biiig log for the error using

```
$ code ~/kong/logs/error.log
```

At the end is this 

```

```

So, I think this error is possible in lua too, like with lua plugins. 
But it can be handled easily in golang I guess? So that it doesn't
show up as such a big error after going to the lua stuff and code.
Instead it can error out at the golang library level itself! It's
just that now there will be some type checks at two levels, one is
already happening in lua code level. Now, probably another in golang.
We can ask the core maintainers if this is what they meant when some
stuff has to be handled. 

Okay, off to bed now!!!! 😴
