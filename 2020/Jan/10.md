# Idea stuff

Usually my ideas come from inspiration (decent word for copying? :P)
by seeing other cool stuff!

One such idea is

Autocompleting yaml files for Kubernetes. I don't know what advanced
navigation they mention. I have to try the plugin in IntelliJ. And
then they mention about documentation. Sounds like a cool idea

This could be an open source plugin if it's already not one, and the
plugin can be made for any editor. Some of the famous ones I know are
sublime text, vs code, atom, brackets

I'm seeing a lot of cool stuff under https://twitter.com/learnk8s :)
