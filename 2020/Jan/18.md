## open source stuff 1

I woke up early today. Was checking some twitter stuff. Saw some tweets
about how an open source maintainer just quit after some craziness. I
didn't understand the details, but it looked really bad!

This post has some details

I read the whole thing even though I didn't understand a lot of stuff ðŸ˜…

# paid extension

Okay, so I started noting down my thoughts for the extension yesterday
and today too. It's still a work in progress. Lots of thoughts on it.
Starting from naming to pricing and implementation too. :) I think I'll
share it once I finish it? :)

I mean, once I finish one version and sell at least once? ðŸ¤” ðŸ™ˆ

I'm planning to use [gumroad.com](https://gumroad.com) for the sales.
