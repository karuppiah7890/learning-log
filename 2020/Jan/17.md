# paid extension

So, today I was checking out gumroad, and thinking about how to create
a browser extension for GitHub and get paid for it too! Gotta see if I
can do it :)

# Day job stuff 1

Today I was mostly working on a script to get some data from our
k8s cluster. I was using `bash`, `jq`, `rg`, `sed`, `kubectl`,
`echo` and for loops and if else and stuff. So, it was a bash
script. We also wrote a node script, that is in Js, to do some
complicated stuff. And then that's it

May be I'll write about `jq`, `yq`, using Js scripts sometime. It's
quite a learning to do some one time stuff using scripts and good
tools! :D 

I could also write all the `jq` stuff that I have done. It will be
useful for myself to look at later. Same for `bash`, `yq` and any cli
tool that I have used!

More like a `Everything that I know about X` :) I think it will be a
consolidated and grouped version of my learning log ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚
