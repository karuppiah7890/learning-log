Okay! So, today, I did some stuff that I'm going to note down
and also note down what I wanna do

## Open Source stuff 1

I first updated my PR here https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7235

## AR !

So, I have wanted to try Augmented Reality stuff for quite some time now.
I even bought a phone for my Mom which has support for ARCore which I was
very particular about :P It's a Xiaomi Poco phone. I do know ARCore support
is not the only thing that's needed to do AR stuff. I mean, so many people
have pokemon go in their phones, not all of them have support for ARCore,
also ARCore is a recent thing, so there must have been some magic stuff
or code that was used before. But for now, I'm going to try ARCore, and then
try other stuff in my phone which doesn't support ARCore. I have also tried
Spark AR before, in my phone. Some AR effects were just too slow and bad ðŸ™ˆ
ðŸ˜…Anyways, some links now

spark ar - https://sparkar.facebook.com/

Now, I'm using this link to try out AR Core using Unity.

I don't know if unity is really needed, but I'm just going to go with it and
try the demo to give it a start! :D :)
