Today I wanted to merge two videos I had. I created these videos using Kap tool
for screen recording. It actually took tons of time to process the video and
make it as a small sized processed mp4 file instead of a big raw mp4 file.
I had two videos because I had to stop and start off another screen recording
as there's no pause feature in Kap unfortunately.

Anyways, I started checking out how to merge the videos. I wanted to upload to
YouTube so I was thinking if YouTube can help. I saw one video and realized it
was about using an external web service.

It would take lots of time to even upload and then for it to process. So I
chucked it. Then I went to GitHub to search for tools to merge.

https://github.com/search?q=merge+videos
https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=merge%20videos
https://github.com/search?q=merge+videos+command+line

https://github.com/khoavd-dev/MergeVideos
https://github.com/jaiobs/OptiVideoEditor-for-android

I also searched npm a bit

https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=merge%20video
https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=merge%20videos

https://www.npmjs.com/package/action-merge-videos
https://www.npmjs.com/package/video-stitch

The video-stitch spoke about ffmpeg. I was like - why not use ffmpeg directly??

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7333232/how-to-concatenate-two-mp4-files-using-ffmpeg#11175851

https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate

I just went ahead and did this then

```bash
$ ls
jenkins-part-1.mp4      jenkins-part-2.mp4
$ printf "file '%s'\n" ./*.mp4 > mylist.txt
$ cat mylist.txt
file './jenkins-part-1.mp4'
file './jenkins-part-2.mp4'
$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4
```

And that's it! :O :D It worked!

```bash
$ open output.mp4
```

I even checked the videos with VLC media player ;)

Uploading it to my channel with https://www.youtube.com/upload

There's my video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW3JihkXIgs

So, I'm trying to create a Docker image for Oracle XE DB.

Currently I created one. But everytime I start it, it takes time to start. So
Oracle has a way to create a prebuilt image that has fast startup time for the
database as all the steps for the database setup is done before hand and is
all captured in the Docker image.

https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/samples/prebuiltdb

The problem is, I ran the temporary container with a volume and then did a commit
and the new prebuilt image didn't work without the volume :/ It seemed as if the
commit doesn't consider the volume mounts. Makes sense, as volume mounts are
external things and not part of the image and it would be polluting the image to
put the contents of volume mounts while doing a commit. Hmm. So now I'm running
the temporary container without the volume mount so that the DB setup is done
in the container file system and not in the volume mount.

I mounted the volume to be able to restart containers. But that should be done
only when I have a prebuilt image, not when I have a brand new image with Oracle
setup not done

Hmm. I did everything okay this time and this happened

```bash
$ docker logs -f 1
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /opt/oracle

```

That's the prebuilt image based container.

I tried some stuff. Not sure which one worked out now. ðŸ™ˆ Stuff I tried
* Increase docker machine disk size frmo 24GB to 32GB
* Create a docker image from running oracle container instead of stopped
container

Now I'm not sure which image I'm using. Is it stopped oracle container image or
running oracle container image. Gotta verify ðŸ™ˆ

I'm now creating a prebuilt image with stopped oracle container

Okay, it works!! :D I think space was the issue. Hmm. Stopped container image
works, just like the steps on oracle github repo for docker images for prebuilt
db

```bash
$ docker logs -f 2b
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /opt/oracle

I'm going to contribute to Liquibase library ;)

I chose a good first issue to start with
