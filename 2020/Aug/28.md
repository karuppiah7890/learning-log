Today I wanted to merge two videos I had. I created these videos using Kap tool
for screen recording. It actually took tons of time to process the video and
make it as a small sized processed mp4 file instead of a big raw mp4 file.
I had two videos because I had to stop and start off another screen recording
as there's no pause feature in Kap unfortunately.

Anyways, I started checking out how to merge the videos. I wanted to upload to
YouTube so I was thinking if YouTube can help. I saw one video and realized it
was about using an external web service.

It would take lots of time to even upload and then for it to process. So I
chucked it. Then I went to GitHub to search for tools to merge.

https://github.com/jaiobs/OptiVideoEditor-for-android

I also searched npm a bit

https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=merge%20video
https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=merge%20videos

https://www.npmjs.com/package/action-merge-videos
https://www.npmjs.com/package/video-stitch

The video-stitch spoke about ffmpeg. I was like - why not use ffmpeg directly??

https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate

I just went ahead and did this then

```bash
$ ls
jenkins-part-1.mp4      jenkins-part-2.mp4
$ printf "file '%s'\n" ./*.mp4 > mylist.txt
$ cat mylist.txt
file './jenkins-part-1.mp4'
file './jenkins-part-2.mp4'
$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4
```

And that's it! :O :D It worked!

```bash
$ open output.mp4
```

I even checked the videos with VLC media player ;)

Uploading it to my channel with https://www.youtube.com/upload
