# August 17th 2020

I have forked the https://github.com/spring-io/initializr.git
repo and also signed their Individual Contributor License
Agreement at https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring

I was planning to checkout this

https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#code-conventions-and-housekeeping

Source code formatting stuff - https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/

But the contribution I'm going to make is for a properties file,
so it wouldn't need all this I guess :P

Oops

https://ci.spring.io/builds/126647

The build failed. Looks like they have tests to check the gradle version.
Of course :P

I gotta fix it!

Cool! I found the places where it broke and I fixed it!

And ran `./mvnw clean install`

And it all worked!! :D :D

I have pushed the changes and it has triggered the CI build only after
quite a few seconds

https://ci.spring.io/builds/126648

Apparently they use the Concourse CI https://concourse-ci.org/ ,
interesting!

And the build passed!! :D

I think I need to start doing some more deep contributions soon!
Hmm
