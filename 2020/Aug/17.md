# August 17th 2020

I have forked the https://github.com/spring-io/initializr.git
repo and also signed their Individual Contributor License
Agreement at https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring

I was planning to checkout this

https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#code-conventions-and-housekeeping

Source code formatting stuff - https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/

But the contribution I'm going to make is for a properties file,
so it wouldn't need all this I guess :P

Oops

https://ci.spring.io/builds/126647

The build failed. Looks like they have tests to check the gradle version.
Of course :P

I gotta fix it!

Cool! I found the places where it broke and I fixed it!

And ran `./mvnw clean install`

And it all worked!! :D :D

I have pushed the changes and it has triggered the CI build only after
quite a few seconds

https://ci.spring.io/builds/126648

Apparently they use the Concourse CI https://concourse-ci.org/ ,
interesting!

And the build passed!! :D

https://ci.spring.io/builds/126648

I think I need to start doing some more deep contributions soon!
Hmm

https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck is using some
old features of Gradle that will become incompatible with Gradle 7.0 .
I wanted to see if I can help with upgrading it to use the new features! :)

$ ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze

These are the clear warnings that it gives! :)

I think the errors could be related to the build code in my project. Hmm

Starting with

https://docs.gradle.org/6.6/userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#dependencies_should_no_longer_be_declared_using_the_compile_and_runtime_configurations

Actually the source code for the gradle plugin is here

https://github.com/jeremylong/dependency-check-gradle

I have started off a gradle build in the project.
There are already two issues that talk about the usage of deprecated
gradle features.

https://github.com/jeremylong/dependency-check-gradle/issues/176
https://github.com/jeremylong/dependency-check-gradle/issues/194

Yeah, there's a duplicate. 

I need to learn some more gradle to understand these issues better!
ðŸ™ˆ

Looks like it needs Java 8 to run, looking at the `build.gradle`
file

```groovy
tasks.withType(GroovyCompile) {
	sourceCompatibility = '1.8'
	targetCompatibility = '1.8'
}
```

I don't know much, but seems like related to Java version since
I have seen something similar in my project for Java 14

And it uses gradle v6.1.1

I'm going to run the docker container and build this inside it!

I was thinking of using gradle docker image, or just java docker
image as gradle wrapper is there. Hmm.

There are two for jdk

https://hub.docker.com/_/adoptopenjdk

https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk

I'm just going to use `openjdk:8`

Cool!

I think I need to learn to create a plugin before trying to contribute
to this one! ðŸ˜… 

So, according to the error, this is old
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/maven_plugin.html

and the new one is
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html

I think that will need quite some code change, hmm

`conf/publish/maven.gradle` seems to have code related to the maven
plugin

And about line 72 and 74 in `build.gradle`, no idea what's going on.
I mean, 72 says this

```groovy
            gradleApi(),
```

78 says this

```groovy
    testCompile gradleTestKit()
```

Hmm. I think I'm just going to learn some basics first. Starting
with groovy language. Something to note is, Gradle supports both
Groovy and Kotlin Script for their scripting

http://www.groovy-lang.org/
http://www.groovy-lang.org/learn.html

http://www.groovy-lang.org/documentation.html#gettingstarted

I have to get started with installing Groovy first

http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html

I can install using `brew`

http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html#osinstall

```bash
$ brew install groovy
```

And I can also get the IDE plugin and Docker image

http://groovy-lang.org/ides.html
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/

https://hub.docker.com/_/groovy/

There's a single page doc too, here

http://www.groovy-lang.org/single-page-documentation.html

Apparently Gradle v4 is the bleeding edge version and v3 is the
stable version. `brew` got me the stable version

```bash
