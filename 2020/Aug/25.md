I recently used Jenkins. I was using the Classic UI of Jenkins. It was quite
hard initially but I got the hang of it soon. It's still confusing at times, so
I have to consciously choose options by thinking a bit.

Apparently it has another UI. I read about this while trying out Jenkins.
It's called Blue Ocean and it seems it can be easily installed by just installing
the Jenkins plugin and that's it! :O

There are options for installing in existing instance or getting a docker image
with Blue Ocean preinstalled

And we can keep switching between the two UIs too! So it's awesome :D
