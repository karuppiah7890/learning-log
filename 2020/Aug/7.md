I recently got access to a bitbucket repo and in the
web UI, I couldn't find any information on the number
of commits. So I decided to just use the command line
to find the number of git commits.

Git commit count -

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/677436/how-do-i-get-the-git-commit-count#4061706

From all branches

```bash
$ git rev-list --count --all
```

From a reference (branch, tag, commit sha, HEAD etc)

```bash
$ git rev-list --count HEAD
$ git rev-list --count master
```

I read a bit about the `rev-list` command

```bash
$ git rev-list --help
```

```
Lists commit objects in reverse chronological order
```

The below gives a big list of commits! ðŸ˜…

```bash
$ git rev-list master
```

We can limit the number of commits using `--max-count`
it seems. And it has some good features, like

```
 the following command:

                   $ git rev-list foo bar ^baz

 means "list all the commits which are reachable from foo or bar, but not from baz".
```

I read in the manual :P Anyways, it seems cool! :)
