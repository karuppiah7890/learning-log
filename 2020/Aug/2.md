So I started off with the next
project in Freecodecamp in
Data Analysis with Python.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer

I got this error while
trying to run without running
test. I did this so that `pandas`
module is installed. It's installed
only after the repl is run atleast
once

```python
Repl.it: Updating package configuration

--> python3 -m poetry lock

[RuntimeError]
The Poetry configuration is invalid:
  - 'description' is a required property

exit status 1


Repl.it: Package operation failed.
```

I fixed it with this answer

The first task is

```
Add an 'overweight' column to the data. To determine if a person is overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight. Use the value 0 for NOT overweight and the value 1 for overweight.
```

I can get a boolean value column. To convert it
into 0 or 1, I would need to do more. But I just
found this

```python
> df['overweight'] = ((df['weight'] / ((df['height']/100)**2)) > 25).astype(int)
```
