A team mate shared this nice link about responses and latency

Today I was checking out how the Spring Boot OCI image building happens with the
gradle task `bootBuildImage` and I found this nice article

https://medium.com/@TimvanBaarsen/first-look-at-cloud-native-buildpacks-support-in-spring-boot-2-3-milestone-1-ece8e72ed93f

I do remember the docs

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.2.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html/#build-image

mentioning about Cloud Native Buildpacks - https://buildpacks.io/, but the
article was still quite useful to also find out about https://paketo.io 

I was however going to find out how the image building happens using buildpacks
in Spring Boot. This is a good start! :)
