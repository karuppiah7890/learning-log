# August 22nd 2020

A team mate shared this nice link about responses and latency

https://github.com/Tendrl/documentation/wiki/Best-Practices-for-Response-Times-and-Latency

---

Today I was checking out how the Spring Boot OCI image building happens with the
gradle task `bootBuildImage` and I found this nice article

https://medium.com/@TimvanBaarsen/first-look-at-cloud-native-buildpacks-support-in-spring-boot-2-3-milestone-1-ece8e72ed93f

I do remember the docs

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.2.RELEASE/gradle-plugin/reference/html/#build-image

mentioning about Cloud Native Buildpacks - https://buildpacks.io/, but the
article was still quite useful to also find out about https://paketo.io 

I was however going to find out how the image building happens using buildpacks
in Spring Boot. This is a good start! :)

I have a sample project here https://github.com/karuppiah7890/spring-stuff/tree/master/example-project

I tried to build image without running docker daemon / engine and this happened

```bash
$ ./gradlew bootBuildImage
Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)

> Task :bootBuildImage FAILED
Building image 'docker.io/library/example-project:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'

 > Pulling builder image 'gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:base-platform-api-0.3' ..................................................

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':bootBuildImage'.
> Docker API call to 'localhost/v1.24/images/create?fromImage=gcr.io%2Fpaketo-buildpacks%2Fbuilder%3Abase-platform-api-0.3' failed with status code 500 "Internal Server Error"

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org

BUILD FAILED in 10s
4 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 3 up-to-date
```

After starting docker daemon, I ran it again

```bash

You can see how it mentions that 5 build packs out of 16 are "participating".
The 5 being -

```
paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica 2.13.0
paketo-buildpacks/executable-jar    2.1.1
paketo-buildpacks/apache-tomcat     1.5.0
paketo-buildpacks/dist-zip          1.4.0
paketo-buildpacks/spring-boot       2.5.0
```

There are also github links to some of these repos, which is also present in
https://paketo.io

https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica

Bellsoft Liberica seems to be a Java JDK. They say they are based on OpenJDK
https://bell-sw.com/

https://github.com/bell-sw/Liberica

There's also a list here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines
But Bellsoft Liberica is not mentioned. Probably needs updation

The whole list of paketo buildpacks are here

https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks

I think the best way to completely understand this whole thing would be to try
out https://buildpacks.io/

https://buildpacks.io/docs/

https://buildpacks.io/docs/install-pack

I'm installing `pack` using this

```bash
brew install buildpacks/tap/pack
```

The codebase is present here - https://github.com/buildpacks/pack

https://github.com/buildpacks

Apparently, `pack` is just ONE implementation of the specificiation - 
https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/platform.md

There's also some reference implementation here -
https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle . Not sure reference for what exactly.
Need to check the spec to understand better!

Okay, so, now, back to the getting started tutorial.

I'm gonna try out the `pack build` command for this repo
https://github.com/buildpacks/samples

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/buildpacks/samples
$ cd samples/apps/java-maven
$ pack build myapp --builder cnbs/sample-builder:bionic
$ pack build myapp --builder cnbs/sample-builder:bionic

ERROR: failed to build: executing lifecycle. This may be the result of using an untrusted builder: failed with status code: 246
```

Again same error. I just noticed the error properly. Damn me. It says "no space
left on device". Weird. I mean, I do have very less space, like 11GB in my
machine. But I thought that would be enough. Hmm

I tried some stuff to get rid of things to get more space. But I forgot that
the docker daemon is using a VM of it's own and has some space allocated for the
VM and I think that's where the issue is. The VM doesn't have enough space.

Tried some stuff

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30604846/docker-error-no-space-left-on-device#37287054

Didn't remove some volumes alone though

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30604846/docker-error-no-space-left-on-device/36584376#36584376

I still faced issues after removing some stuff. Now I removed everything! Let's
see how that works!

This time again a failure, but it said something about no layers being found.
Maybe it's because I deleted stuff while it was running. I don't know. Now
I have run it again. Let's see

Since this is taking a lot of time. I'm going to checkout the next tutorial

Continuing on creating a buildpack for ruby app! :)

Some trivia about buildpacks - Heroku and Pivotal worked on Buildpacks together.
There's some docs on buildpacks with respect to Cloud Foundry - 
https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/ . I'm able to see some similarity with
that and the docs of buildpacks.io

https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/building-blocks-cnb/#detect-and-build

```bash
$ mkdir bin
$ cd bin
$ cat > detect
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail

exit 1
$ cat > build
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail

echo "---> Ruby Buildpack"
exit 1
$ chmod +x detect build
```

It's asking me to set a default builder but I don't want to. Hmm. I'm going to
just move on and see how to pass the builder

```bash
$ pack build test-ruby-app --path ruby-sample-app --buildpack ruby-cloud-native-build
pack/
Please select a default builder with:

        pack set-default-builder <builder-image>

Suggested builders:
        Google:                gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1      Ubuntu 18 base image with buildpacks for .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, and Python
        Heroku:                heroku/buildpacks:18              heroku-18 base image with buildpacks for Ruby, Java, Node.js, Python, Golang, & PHP
        Paketo Buildpacks:     paketobuildpacks/builder:base     Ubuntu bionic base image with buildpacks for Java, NodeJS and Golang
        Paketo Buildpacks:     paketobuildpacks/builder:full     Ubuntu bionic base image with buildpacks for Java, NodeJS and Golang
        Paketo Buildpacks:     paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny     Tiny base image (bionic build image, distroless run image) with buildpacks for Golang

Tip: Learn more about a specific builder with:
        pack inspect-builder <builder-image>
```

Okay, so I must set a default builder huh. I'm thinking if I can explicitly
mention one

```bash
$ pack build --help
Generate app image from source code

Usage:
  pack build <image-name> [flags]

Flags:
  -B, --builder string           Builder image
  -b, --buildpack strings        Buildpack reference in the form of '<buildpack>@<version>',
                                   path to a buildpack directory (not supported on Windows),
                                   path/URL to a buildpack .tar or .tgz file, or
                                   the name of a packaged buildpack image
                                 Repeat for each buildpack in order,
                                   or supply once by comma-separated list
      --clear-cache              Clear image's associated cache before building
  -D, --default-process string   Set the default process type. (default "web")
  -d, --descriptor string        Path to the project descriptor file
  -e, --env stringArray          Build-time environment variable, in the form 'VAR=VALUE' or 'VAR'.
                                 When using latter value-less form, value will be taken from current
                                   environment at the time this command is executed.
                                 This flag may be specified multiple times and will override
                                   individual values defined by --env-file.
      --env-file stringArray     Build-time environment variables file
                                 One variable per line, of the form 'VAR=VALUE' or 'VAR'
                                 When using latter value-less form, value will be taken from current
                                   environment at the time this command is executed
  -h, --help                     Help for 'build'
      --network string           Connect detect and build containers to network
  -p, --path string              Path to app dir or zip-formatted file (defaults to current working directory)
      --publish                  Publish to registry
      --pull-policy string       Pull policy to use. Accepted values are always, never, and if-not-present. (default "always")
      --run-image string         Run image (defaults to default stack's run image)
      --trust-builder            Trust the provided builder
                                 All lifecycle phases will be run in a single container (if supported by the lifecycle).
      --volume stringArray       Mount host volume into the build container, in the form '<host path>:<target path>[:<mode>]'.
                                 Repeat for each volume in order,
                                   or supply once by comma-separated list

Global Flags:
      --no-color     Disable color output
  -q, --quiet        Show less output
      --timestamps   Enable timestamps in output
  -v, --verbose      Show more output
```

This worked

```bash
$ pack build test-ruby-app --path ruby-sample-app --buildpack ruby-cloud-native-buildpack/ --builder heroku/buildpacks:18
```

So I didn't have to run

```bash
$ pack set-default-builder heroku/buildpacks:18
```

or

```bash
$ pack set-default-builder cloudfoundry/cnb:cflinuxfs3
```

But I got an error for the build

```bash

Btw, the `heroku/buildpacks` is an image for the builder. It's here
https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/buildpacks

All tags - https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/buildpacks/tags , including `18`

https://hub.docker.com/layers/heroku/buildpacks/18/images/sha256-727ead7351cefc3e4bd7886466fa42aff53a4d027986153d422da499b9a7e125?context=explore

https://hub.docker.com/u/heroku

Apparently, the `build` is supposed to fail. Oh yeah. I just realized that the
scripts I created for `detect` and `build` are exiting with status code / exit
code 1 which means unsuccessful!

Next
https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/detection/

Okay, now I fix the `detect` script to detect that it's actually a ruby app
by checking if `Gemfile` file is present at the root of the app source code /
project

```bash
if [[ ! -f Gemfile ]]; then
   exit 100
fi
```

I ran `build` again

```bash

```

So, it detected the example ruby buildpack I created, and analyzes if there's
any existing image. Apparently this is for reusing the layers of the previous
image, if possible. Makes sense.

Next it tries to build, but fails. This is because of the
failing `build` script I wrote

https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/build-app/

I'm going to change the `build` script

```bash
$ vi ruby-cloud-native-buildpack/bin/build
$ cat ruby-cloud-native-buildpack/bin/build
set -eo pipefail

echo "---> Ruby Buildpack"

It says `exec format error`. Seems like an error which usually happens when a
binary or executable of a different OS / architecture is executed

Oops. I realized the issue. I didn't put a shebang (`#!`) in the build script.
Damn it :P

```

I'm not sure where this `build` script was run. I'm guessing inside a docker
container? I should have checked if there are any extra docker containers
running or images present

Okay, I tried the build again and saw a docker container

```bash
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```

I ran it again and checked what's running inside the container

```bash
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                            COMMAND                  CREATED                  STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

So yeah, all that stuff was running inside the container

Apparently, the app image is not runnable yet

It says `Reusing gems`! :D

It still takes time to download and extract ruby, and also install bundler.
Maybe if that's cached too, then it will be more faster!! :D :D

Next is
https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/make-buildpack-configurable/

Now we are going to make the buildpack configurable! :D

Help the apps configure the ruby version they want to run with

```bash

   exit 100
fi

plan=$2
version=2.5.1

if [[ -f .ruby-version ]]; then
    version=$(cat .ruby-version | tr -d '[:space:]')
fi

echo "provides = [{ name = \"ruby\" }]" > "$plan"
echo "requires = [{ name = \"ruby\", version = \"$version\" }]" >> "$plan"

```

Unfortunately, there's no link to my favorite section

```
Caching the downloaded Ruby version
```

There IS a link to the next thing though

https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack/

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/karuppiahn/oss/github.com/buildpacks
$ ls
samples
$ cat > package.toml
[buildpack]
uri = "samples/buildpacks/hello-universe/"

[[dependencies]]
uri = "samples/buildpacks/hello-moon"

[[dependencies]]
image = "cnbs/sample-package:hello-world"

$ ls
package.toml    samples
```

package.toml docs:
https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/config/package-config/

I was able to find the `cnbs/sample-package` docker image from docker hub

https://hub.docker.com/r/cnbs/sample-package
https://hub.docker.com/r/cnbs/sample-package/tags

Spring has some options to customize stuff -
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/gradle-plugin/reference/html/#build-image

One is builder image, another is run image. I don't know what's the run image,
but I do know what's a builder, I think. Gotta read more I guess :P

And for the builder image, the default is

gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:base-platform-api-0.3

Going to http://gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder lead to

https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/paketo-buildpacks/GLOBAL/builder

On filtering with the tag `base-platform-api-0.3`, it leads us to

https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/paketo-buildpacks/GLOBAL/builder@sha256:5e0a48bf0960e0f3c169a90058e5b7c4b76bc8b2cfabb9d2d4e296262145523c/details?tab=info

And there are more buildpacks here

https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/paketo-buildpacks

or short form is `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks`

There's one for AdoptOpenJDK too

https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/paketo-buildpacks/GLOBAL/adopt-openjdk

or short form is `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk`

https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk

I checked the codebase and there was some very basic Golang code and I realized
that they use some Golang code to do the detection and stuff. I saw these
libraries being used

https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/libjvm

https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/libpak

There's some script here

https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/scripts/build.sh

to build the golang programs and then it's linked to the the `bin/detect` and
`bin/build`! Not sure how the program differentiates between the two calls to
it from `pack`

I think it's only fair to use Golang, to keep it cross platform and to also
get binaries very easily. We don't have to worry about shell not working in
windows or something. Anyways the support for windows has to be checked I think.
Hmm

I think it should be supported. Given I see `pack` available for Windows too

https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases

---

The concepts of `pack` can be learned from here!

https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts

We can also create a builder - 
https://buildpacks.io/docs/operator-guide/create-a-builder/

But I'm not gonna create one now immediately! :)

---

I was just now checking out what a builder is here

https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/

It contains
* Buildpacks
* Lifecycle
* Stack's build image

https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/buildpack/
https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/lifecycle/
https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/stack/

Okay, that was a lot of information for a day. I think I'll have to revisit
some stuff again when necessary. 

I did notice some stuff about build time image and run time image. I think that's
cool!

I finally made the ruby download cached! :)

I was checking about contributing to buildpacks

https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/contributors/guide.md
https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/contributors/guide.md#community-contributor

And noticed some stuff here

https://github.com/buildpacks/pack-orb/issues

Might have to look into what are CircleCI orbs to contribute 😅
