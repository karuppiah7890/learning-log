Today I'm checking out different Java ORMs
present. I have heard about Hibernate a lot
before and even used it a bit in one of my
internships. But it was too complex and
vague for me at the time. So now I'm trying
to get my hands on this thing again now.

I was also checking out the n+1 query problem.
And this stackoverflow short answer helped

For Java ORMs, I saw this debate here a bit

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452385/what-java-orm-do-you-prefer-and-why#1483378

Some mention Hibernate, some say "No ORMs"

I have actually used a bit of ORMs in Ruby with
Ruby on Rails (RoR), but that's it I think.

And I have heard about using connecting pooling in
general when connecting to any store using the
store driver / module / library. The number of
connections in the connection pool is usually
configurable and almost any matured library will
support connection pooling. The library is needed
as different stores have different APIs and their
own protocols over TCP. Even if the API is a HTTP
API, there might be different endpoints, different
request parameters and responses and error handling
and serialization and deserilization to be done. It's
easier if that is all delegated to a library, and a
good programmatic API - functions, methods, classes,
constants etc is provided, and internally, the
communication with the store is taken care by the
library :)
