So, today I wanted to do some YouTube
videos - screencast / screen recordings.

I usually do it with OBS (usually for streaming)
or with Kap tool

https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio

https://github.com/wulkano/kap

Kap has plugins for stuff. I was looking for a plugin
to show keys pressed in my mac so that my screen
recordings can show what keys I'm pressing - like
shortcuts etc, so that people can learn

I couldn't find any kap plugin. Then I resorted to
looking for softwares that can do it in general,
standalone and found this

https://github.com/karaggeorge/macos-key-cast

It looks cool ! :D :D I just had to do

```bash
$ npx macos-key-cast
```

And that's it! :D

I just found another video on youtube mentioning
about another tool -

https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr

But it seems to have quite some installation stuff
to do to get it working, I don't know. I think
macos key cast works because my terminal has
access to do everything, so probably extra work
wasn't necessary, but standalone tools would
need extra permissions, hence extra work, on
new Mac OS versions especially

I uploaded my own video! :D

In my current project, we have REST APIs and UI development
and we need to do testing for them and also do contract
testing. One of the tools that we are checking out is -
Karate

https://github.com/intuit/karate

https://intuit.github.io/karate/

In their latest release, as of this writing

https://github.com/intuit/karate/releases/latest
https://github.com/intuit/karate/releases/tag/v0.9.5

In this release, they have put links about Web Automation
testing and about why they built something new and as an
alternative to Selenium

https://hackernoon.com/the-world-needs-an-alternative-to-selenium-so-we-built-one-zrk3j3nyr

I think it's good to have some options for tools and some
competition. :)

One thing to note is, I don't know if the developers of the
tools have checked out Taiko 

https://taiko.gauge.org

Given they are great developers doing cool stuff, I hope they
would have checked it out, given Taiko can select things without
selectors etc. I can see karate still have some selector stuff,
but I gotta dig to understand better. Anyways, something new to
explore and checkout! :)
