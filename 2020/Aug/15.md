So, today I wanted to do some YouTube
videos - screencast / screen recordings.

I usually do it with OBS (usually for streaming)
or with Kap tool

Kap has plugins for stuff. I was looking for a plugin
to show keys pressed in my mac so that my screen
recordings can show what keys I'm pressing - like
shortcuts etc, so that people can learn

I couldn't find any kap plugin. Then I resorted to
looking for softwares that can do it in general,
standalone and found this

It looks cool ! :D :D

I just found another video on youtube mentioning
about another tool -

But it seems to have quite some installation stuff
to do to get it working, I don't know. I think
macos key cast works because my terminal has
access to do everything, so probably extra work
wasn't necessary, but standalone tools would
need extra permissions, hence extra work, on
new Mac OS versions especially

I uploaded my own video! :D
