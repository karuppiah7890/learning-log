# August 8th 2020

Okay, I'm continuing my freecodecamp
Data Analysis with Python project on
medical data! :D

The next task is

```
Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of 'cholestorol' or 'gluc' is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.
```

I think they are basing it off of the first
point about `overweight`. I think what they
mean is, if `overweight` is `0`, then `cardio`
is `0` - meaning no issues and all good, and
when `overweight` is `1`, then they are overweight
and the value of `cardio` is `1` and there are
issues! Of course!

I think I could use the ternary kind of operator
that I learned in python!

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 4 if 5 < 6 else 7;
>>> b
4
>>> c = 10 if 5 > 6 else 20;
>>> c
20
>>>
```

I think I could use that! :D Maybe I could have
used it for the last task too. Hmm...anyways.
Down to work!

Currently, with no modifications

```python
> df['cardio'].value_counts()
0    35021
1    34979
Name: cardio, dtype: int64
```

```python
> df['overweight'] = ((df['weight'] / ((df['height']/100)**2)) > 25).astype(int)
> df['cardio'] = 0 if df['overweight'] == 0 else 1;
```

Actually, if you think about it, the only possible
values for `df['overweight']` is `0` or `1`, as we
converted `bool` values to integer `0` or `1`,
when `overweight` is `0`, `cardio` should be `0`,
when `overweight` is `1`, `cardio` should be `1`.
Well, I could just assign the value of `overweight`
to `cardio` 🤷‍♂️ Like this

```python
> df['cardio'] = df['overweight']
> df['cardio'].value_counts()
1    43546
0    26454
Name: cardio, dtype: int64
```

That was a crazy big change!

Now, the next thing to look at is - 

```
If the value of 'cholestorol' or 'gluc' is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.
```

I was thinking of creating a function that can
take a colum / series of data and then give back
a column / series. This way, I can do the above
in a function, even though it seems too simple

Actually, the above needs two series of data as
input - `cholesterol` and `gluc` column data

I found this link

https://riptutorial.com/pandas/example/21562/applying-a-function-to-a-series

This looks like a nice tutorial on applying
a function on a series - like, for each value
on a series. It means there's only one input -
one series. It uses the `apply` function

Similar tutorial here I guess

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/apply-a-function-to-single-or-selected-columns-or-rows-in-pandas-dataframe/

I think this one was good

https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/udf-python-pandas.html

In the sense that it showed how the function will
look like in general - 

```python
def multiply_func(a: pd.Series, b: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    return a * b
```

I'm going to do just that!

```python
def processCholesterolAndGlucose(cholesterol: pd.Series, gluc: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    return 0 if ( cholesterol == 1 | gluc == 1 ) else 1 if ( cholesterol > 1 | gluc > 1 )
```

It gave me a big fat error

```bash
File "<stdin>", line 2
    return 0 if ( cholesterol == 1 | gluc == 1 ) else 1 if ( cholesterol > 1 | gluc > 1 )
                                                                                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

But this is helping

https://www.golinuxcloud.com/python-if-else-one-line/#Python_if_elif_else_in_one_line

The thing is this, I don't know what to do when both
conditions are not true. Like, they both are not 1,
and when they both are less than 1. And for this
I checked the decription of both the columsn. This is
what I got

```python
> df['cholesterol'].describe()
count    70000.000000
mean         1.366871
std          0.680250
min          1.000000
25%          1.000000
50%          1.000000
75%          2.000000
max          3.000000
Name: cholesterol, dtype: float64

> df['gluc'].describe()
count    70000.000000
mean         1.226457
std          0.572270
min          1.000000
25%          1.000000
50%          1.000000
75%          1.000000
max          3.000000
Name: gluc, dtype: float64
```

The minimum value is 1 always. Feels like the value
of both `cholesterol` and `gluc` cannot be less than
1 according to the data. 1 is like the minimum - or
the least value in the whole thing, so it cannot be
less than that. I don't know what to do if some future
data holds values for `cholesterol` and `gluc` less
than 1? Should it put a `NaN` (Not a Number) in the
data column?
