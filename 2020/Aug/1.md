# August 1st 2020

Today I'm continuing my quest in
data analysis. I'm going through
the freecodecamp data analysis
course. Currently checking out
some videos.

The current videos are something
that I already know most about.
Thinking if I should still see them.

One new thing that I learned is
there's a free service called
Notebooks that can host jupyter
lab, which has jupyter notebook.

Till date, I have come across the
following tools or services to help
with Jupyter Notebooks
* Local Jupyter Notebook
* Local Jupyter Lab which contains
Jupyter Notebook along with other
things
* Google Colab - which contains
Jupyter Notebook along with
collaboration - people can comment
on cells, people can execute cells
and it will show who last executed
a cell. It also provides a table of
contents on the left based on 
headings and it provides a way to
link to the different headings and
scroll to them. It contains all the
features of Jupyter notebook too,
I believe. Colab seems to be free.
I tried it only in my company
google account though. I noticed that
it connects to a Cloud Python 3
runtime, and it was inside a Google
Compute Engine. It shows stats about
the machine - like RAM, CPU. Since
Colab is a collaborative thing,
it has versions and stores the
cell output, along with who
executed last. Sometimes I have
noticed it to have save issues,
showing merge conflicts - usually
in real time collaborative editing,
automatic merge conflict resolution
is done, and that's the beauty of it.
I think here it was kind of tough,
similar to how it's hard to do
automatic in git in some cases. So,
Colab shows the diff to the user
and asks the user to save the 
changes.
* Notebooks - https://notebooks.ai 
seems to be an "always free, free
forever" tool that hosts Jupyter
Lab in the cloud. I noticed that
the limiting thing is storage.
They provide 1GB storage by default.
That's still a lot. Also, by inviting
friends, we can get more, upto 3GB
it seems. And they have some pricing
plans for more, but I'm not able to
access their pricing page at all
for some reason
* Jupyter Hub - https://github.com/jupyterhub
	* https://jupyter.org/hub
	* https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub
* Binder - https://mybinder.org/
	https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
	* BinderHub - https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub
	https://binderhub.readthedocs.io


Jupyter notebooks can have
* Markdown
* Python Code

Each of these are put in cells.
Everything is put inside cells it
seems. Each cell is either a
code cell or text (markdown) cell

Apparently the code can be any
programming language and not
just python! I noticed notebooks.ai
mentioning about R, Julia and Python
code!

I can also see Juypter notebook
website - https://jupyter.org/
showing so many languages. I don't
know if it's possible, but it does
show many programming languages,
including compiled ones too,
like golang! But I couldn't find
anything in the documentation.
Maybe I'll check it out later!

Okay, I just checked a bit
now :P There was this thing
called Kernels in Jupyter
docs - https://jupyter.org/documentation

I can see "IPython", "IRKernel",
"IJulia". IPython is short for
Interactive Python. Same for R
and Julia. And they are called
"Kernels".

There's a kernel for Golang.
I found one over here - 
https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes
There might be more for golang ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I just found out another tool
by lurking around
https://nteract.io/

nteract was mentioned in
gophernotes golang kernel, which
is a golang kernel for BOTH
Jupyter notebooks AND nteract

gophernotes seems cool! Something
to use when teaching golang
may be

Under the hood gophernotes uses
gomacro - https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro 
as the Golang interpreter it seems

nteract seems like something
similar to Jupyter notebook.
It too supports multiple
languages and has kernels for
them https://nteract.io/kernels

hydrogen - running code
interactively inside atom text
editor! including showing
plots with python code! kind of
like jupyter notebook experience
but in the text editor itself!
