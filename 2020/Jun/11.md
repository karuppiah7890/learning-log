Open Telemetry

```
OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You can analyze them using Prometheus, Jaeger, and other observability tools.
```

I'm going to learn how to use Open Telemetry
in a golang project. I think I need to use
more than one microservice and it's used in
a microservice world.

I think I'll create three microservices?
Or I could create the fibonacci microservice
that I saw in the demo of Open Telemetry here

It will be useful to understand about Open
Telemtry using that :)
