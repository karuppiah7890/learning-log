When writing golang programs, I found this environment variable
called `CGO_ENABLED` for building golang programs, which I set to 0
to get a "statically linked binary" by doing this `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -v`,
which was infact making sure that no C stuff is going to work, even if present.
I'm yet to read more about it though.

I remember me and my team thinking about how some features in our tool might not
work if we do `CGO_ENABLED=0`. I used to wonder how one would find which package
of their application uses `cgo` and I searched for it

and found this

So, apparently doing this will help it seems

```bash
$ go list -f "{{if .CgoFiles}}{{.ImportPath}}{{end}}" $(go list -f "{{.ImportPath}}{{range .Deps}} {{.}}{{end}}")
```

according to this answer
https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/655kax/how_to_figure_out_whats_using_cgo/dg85l1d/

and I tried it out in the helm repo and I got this

```bash
$ cd helm
helm $ cd cmd/helm
helm $  go list -f "{{if .CgoFiles}}{{.ImportPath}}{{end}}" $(go list -f "{{.ImportPath}}{{range .Deps}} {{.}}{{end}}")
crypto/x509
net
os/user
runtime/cgo
```

It's weird how they use this in their `Makefile` for build though

```
.PHONY: build-cross
build-cross: LDFLAGS += -extldflags "-static"
build-cross: $(GOX)
        GO111MODULE=on CGO_ENABLED=0 $(GOX) -parallel=3 -output="_dist/{{.OS}}-{{.Arch}}/$(BINNAME)" -osarch='$(TARGETS)' $(GOFLAGS) -tags '$(TAGS)' -ldflags '$(LDFLAGS)' ./cmd/helm
```

Gotta think sometime on how it works, by understanding what `CGO_ENABLED` exactly does.
