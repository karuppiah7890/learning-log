Someone recently told me their opinion
about usage of non-open source tools to do
anything related to open source software. For
example, using slack as a communication tool
for an open source community but slack itself
being closed source. GitHub, Discord being
similar examples.

I just had a few softwares in my mind which
are alternatives to these and one can host
it themselves freely. Slack - Mattermost.
Discord - Mattermost again as Discord is
kind of like slack to me. GitHub - GitLab.
GitLab Community Edition is open source. 
gitlab.com is Enterprise Edition
by the way.

There's also a popular open source software
for forums, called Discourse. Could be thought
of as an alternative for Stack Overflow.

Here's an article that the person asked me
to read which I read only today, though I had
the link long ago ðŸ˜…

It was a good article! I didn't understand some
stuff though :P I need to probably read again.
Also, it's an old article, with references to
quite some old software, and some new ones too,
like GitHub. But they do make a good point. I
just don't know how companies will make money
though. The open core model is good though.
Like GitLab. In which case, people can host
their own GitLab instance. Or they can use
something like Gitea

https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea

And host it themselves. And even host their
Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery /
Continuous Deployment using open source tools 
like Drone CI and others. GitLab in fact has 
it's own CI system along with a GitLab runner.
There's GoCD too. Some links: 

https://drone.io/
https://www.gocd.org/

Looks like Drone CI also has some Enterprise
Edition. I mean, happens. People need money.
They can't work for free ðŸ˜…

I guess, the best way to go is - if you can
afford a server or a few servers, low cost,
less or more resourceful one, just host things
yourself.

In my case, I can't afford to spend on these
stuff so I'll stick to GitHub. It's not that
really different to switch to GitLab as even
gitlab.com is Enterprise Edition, which is
some closed source version of the Community
Edition with some features.

Can't use the very old stuff like 

https://savannah.gnu.org/

So, for now, it's okay for me I guess.

Oh. Looks like there's a video to it
too! I just noticed the top of the page :P
Gotta check it out sometime... :P
