I was simply checking out `gopls` issues. `gopls` is the language server for
the Go programming language.

https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls

And then I was checking contributing

https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/contributing.md

Found the issues labelled `gopls`, and along with it `help wanted` label too

https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agopls

https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agopls+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

And then I was checking this issue

https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38300

And digged deep into it.

Recently when working on a client proposal, I was hearing lot of new terms about
architecture and about evolutionary architecture. Was thinking may be I should
read about it.

I just got some links to check it out
