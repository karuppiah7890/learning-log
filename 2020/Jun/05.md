# June 5th 2020

I was helping some helping in kubernetes slack and learned quite some stuff and
recalled stuff I learned too, with respect to kubernetes clusters, and
networking and also a bit of helm

At one point, there was this problem - we knew a process was running in the
system, but we didn't know how to check it's logs. And I found this link

Something about using `strace` command. I simply wanted to try it out.

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/58550/how-to-view-the-output-of-a-running-process-in-another-bash-session

With just the process ID, you could see the contents it would print in the
logs (stdout)

I tried this in docker. I could have used a `multipass` or `vagrant` VM.
Anyways. With docker, I got some permissions errors for `strace`, I finally
had to run this

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ubuntu sh
```

I ran a demo script, like this

```bash
$ cat demo.sh
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    echo $RANDOM;
    sleep 1;
done

$ ./demo.sh &
```

And then I opened another shell, because this shell was always showing numbers,
even though it was on background, and I was okay with that then.

In the other shell I tried this

```bash
# found process id
$ ps aux
$ strace -p <process-id>
```

and it gave me tons of output, along with the script's output in one field or
something. It was cool actually!

I was thinking of using the information in `/proc` to know about the process.
Let's see. May be there's a way to do it using `/proc` files and directories.
