Are You Toxic? 10 Ways to Tell (And How to Stop)

I'm trying to work on this issue here -
https://github.com/thecasualcoder/dobby/issues/8

The problem is to - push docker images to docker hub on releases / tags
automatically from Travis CI.

I'm checking out the problems related to
- How to push image only on tags
- How to authenticate with Docker Hub using tokens
- Where to put the token
- How to build image and push it using travis CI

The links I used are these

https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/#conditional-releases-with-on

https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/script

So, I know how to push on tags. And there's a special / custom thing for
deployments where there are no providers and you have something custom, in this
case it's Docker Hub image pushing. I don't know the difference between a
normal job and a deploy actually. Wait. Usually, deploy has some internal
code which is how it knows how to deploy to some services. But then what's the
difference between a custom script deployment vs a simple job which does
docker push in the command line? Hmm. I think it's more about how deploy is
run after every other step is successful. Hmm. There's some stuff like
after_success etc

https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/custom/

But it doesn't have conditional deployment, where the condition for me is,
deploy only on tags.

The only thing to do now is, check about how to get the Docker Hub token.

And for using it, there are two ways, one is, put the token in the travis CI
settings, or the other is, put it in the travis CI yaml. If we put in yaml,
people don't need access to the travis CI to change it. And the forks of the
repo cannot use the secrets in the yaml. It can only be used by the repo whos'
owners created it and travis CI server can of course read it, but it will only
be done for original repo, not for forks. So, no worries of someone cloning
and somehow running travis CI build and then creating a security issue. I should
try it sometime though. Hmm :P

I'm going to try both methods actually. One is, with the secret in yaml, and the
other is with the secret in settings. Will check the maintainers what they think
and go with that! :)

Finally I got something to work! :D ;)
