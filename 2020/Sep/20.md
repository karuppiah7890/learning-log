I was recently working on a login UI web page and was struggling with the CSS.
We had a design and we needed to match the design in our web page.

I was learning a bit about positioning here 
https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp

I think I might also checkout CSS Grid or Flex box and see if I should use them
or not. I just know that they are pretty new layout systems and pretty fancy.
But that's it.
