# September 2nd 2020

Today I want to try out Keycloak software. I have been hearing
about this a lot, but haven't tried it out

https://www.keycloak.org/

https://www.keycloak.org/about

Looks like Keycloak has tons of features for anything related to
Authentication and Authorization. It's an Identity and Access
Management system (IAM)

Feels like an Open Source version of auth0.com . It's cool!! :D

www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/index.html

I plan to use Docker to run keycloak

https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-containers

I know there's an image here
https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak
The page doesn't load now though

I'm running in standalone mode for now. Not sure what that
means. I have noticed keycloak can run with a database,
like Postgres, or Oracle, maybe standalone is like running without
a database

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin jboss/keycloak
```

I went to the web app at http://localhost:8080

It redirected me to http://localhost:8080/auth and showed a UI

I got into the admin console with admin credentials I had already used

I tried to see if there was any signup page using private window.
Actually, I could have used Firefox containers too. Anyways, I wasn't
able to find a signup or register thingy.

In the admin console, I found a setting which spoke about registration
under

Configure > Realm Settings > Login > User Registration

I was able to signup then. But the only option I had was to get into
signin page of admin console, and after signup, of course it told I
didn't have permissions to see the admin console. Not sure if there's
anything that I can see. I surely can see my settings, where I can
change my email, name, password, and also have 2 factor authentication
using time based one time password (TOTP) using Google Authenticator and
similar tools or apps that help with TOTP password managment

In the admin console, I can notice the term "Master". I realized it's
a realm. I have been hearing the term a lot now. I can see that I can
add new realms now

I have created a new realm, a new user. Apparently master realm should
not be used for anything it seems. Separate realms have to be created
for usage. Master is just for admins I guess

I'm now stuck at the securing application part
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/index.html#securing-a-sample-application

Gotta see how to secure an application using Keycloak. I remember
people telling how we need some sort of authentication service to
use keycloak. Gotta see
