I read a really good blog post today

I think I need to create some good habits! ðŸ˜…

Some good habits I can think of are - watching LESS of Netflix :P and not a lot.
Reading some good books - especially the tons of non tech ones that I already
bought and have. The only thing is that, a lot of them I bought are all ebooks.
And I don't have any fancy devices to read, but I think I can still read it
fine. I got the ebooks as they felt cheaper than the very very costly paperback
versions of them.

Another good habit is - to share what I read to my team mates and office mates!

I read another blog post yesterday -

That was good too!! :)
