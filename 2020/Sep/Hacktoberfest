Whatever happens, we will learn from our experiences. We will
learn from anyone and everyone.

"I am because we are"

What are doing - very less people in the world do. Not everyone
goes around and helps people. Not everyone goes around and teaches
people their craft and their learnings from their experience, that
too for nothing in return.

Let me tell you that you actually get something in return. You get
the opportunity and privilege to say that you motivated a group of
people. You will have the opportunity to be a teacher. You will have
the opportunity to learn how to teach. I think we are always learning
from everyone. If you are like me, I think you would grab
opportunities whenever it comes to you.

Don't compete. Share and learn. Respect everyone. Don't aim to be
ignorant. Do your research. Always learn from others, learn from
your history.

Take inspiration from other people. Take inspiration from the nature,
that has taught us so much. Take inspiration from different fields,
like sports. Lead silently. Make noise when it's necessary. Give
credit where it's due.
