I continued watching the Nomad Virtual Day today. Still watching it!

It was a good experience to see a case study about how Roblox uses
Nomad and also checkout Nomad's auto scaling feature and how it
plugs in with APM services and nomad's own metrics and with
prometheus too! And the community can contribute to it by creating
more plugins since it's all plugin based!

I also found out that hashicorp has an online community - I mean,
every company or big software has it, like kubernetes has a slack,
similary Hashicorp has a discourse forum here -

https://discuss.hashicorp.com/

And they have different topics for their different open source
products. They also have topics for community events / meetups
and even jobs! :) Stories are also a section - where you can
share your story :D

They are also live on twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/hashicorplive

I found all of this out when searching for their community and
found this page 

https://www.hashicorp.com/community

Of course there are a lot of links to their online presence! :)

https://www.youtube.com/hashicorp

Hashicorp specific meetups for the Hashicorp User Groups (HUGs)
are also present in many parts of the world -

I also found out that Roblox has their github here

Found out about diago recently through the golang weekly mail

It's a tool to visualize the profiles that pprof generates

I need to try this out sometime. The article snapshots look really
cool !

tag: golang, profiling, visualzation

Regarding profiling, recently I also saw this project called
https://github.com/profefe/profefe

It's about continuously collecting profiling data for long
term postmortem analysis

There's one more project in https://github.com/profefe/
The kube-profefe to make running profefe easier for pods running
in kubernetes :)

People are just creating new awesome tools everyday !

https://github.com/dtgorski/typex

Found this too on golang weekly. So this helps you with checking
out all the type structures and interfaces it seems

" Filter and examine Go type structures, interfaces and especially their transitive dependencies and relationships. "

I think the concepts in this will help me in making another
tool which will need information about the exported types,
interfaces, constants and what not - in short, everything
that's exported - the tool's responsibility is to find out
if a Pull Request has made breaking changes or not :)
One can tell a change is breaking only if the exported
entitty is changed in a breaking manner - in terms of
naming, signature, behavior. The tool cannot check
behavior, but we can check naming and signature :)

The roblox company mentioned that they use portworx a lot - looks like 
a paid sofware to me. But they have done some open source contributions too! :)

I just read about how Consul can be used for Application Feature Toggle
configuration storage. Consul apart from being a famous service discovery
solution, also has a KV - Key Value store. Now, why would people wanna
store application configuration in consul? Why not environment variables?
Configuration including Application Feature Toggles

So, the thing is this - if the configuration is environment variables,
you have to restart your application / re deploy your application
when you change the environment variable values. Now you wouldn't
want to do that in some cases. I have heard this issue before and I
have also seen how some teams solve this and heard about some solutions
out there

So, the idea is to - not redeploy / restart you application / service,
but still change the configuration - meaning dynamic configuration. 
Cloud platforms are now providing services for exactly this. I have
heard of "Parameter stores" that store configuration. Also, don't
consider configurations to be "not secrets" and then have secrets
separately. If you want to make your life easy, I would follow
what once a speaker told in one of the meetups that I attended,
"we just didn't want to handle configurations and secrets
separately. so, we decided to consider them the same, why
should configurations not be secure, they must be secure,
so we decided - let's not treat configurations separately,
let's consider all things as secrets". So, just do that,
consider everything as a secret - you could also use vault
or something to store your configurations and secrets ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Now back to the dynamic configuration, apart from cloud
services with APIs, to read from and write to the parameter store,
I have seen people use etcd to store their configuration.
And now consul - well, practically any storage, could be used.
These are fast, simple, light weight key values stores with
execptional capabilities, so yeah, it's cool. Here's the
article I read - 

https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/application-feature-toggles-with-hashicorp-consul

While reading this - I also found out that there's a separate
service to help with feature toggles and it's management - wow.
