So, today I plan to see if I can start implementing a VNC server.
Ideally I would want cross platform but that might be a stretch.
I'm lazy, so I'm thinking of just supporting mac os for now, and
also check if mac os provides any APIs to share the screen
through some technology. As I already know there's a share screen
feature provided by default by Mac - I'm not sure if it works
across the public Internet - I have seen it work within private
networks :) Gotta check if and how it works over public Internet.
Like, what ports are used by the process that does networking,
and how are firewalls taken care of.

So, let's get started with checking if the features provided
by Screen Sharing App are available through an API :)

So, I couldn't find exactly about screen sharing. I did find
about a broadcasting method. Not sure if I should check it out.

Just saw these links for ReplayKit and for mac os development. I think
swift UI is the new thing

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/replaykit

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/
https://developer.apple.com/develop/
https://developer.apple.com/macos/
https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/

https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/
https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/replaykit mentions that
there's support for Mac OS catalyst.

https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/

Looks like that means it can be done in mac os. But now that I think
about it, I mean, I don't know if I really want broadcasting feature
of sorts. OBS can help with that. I could just use OBS if I wanna do
that. I could learn a bit of swift UI but meh. Also, apparently, it's
not like one size fits all, I mean, it kinda makes sense. That's not
easily possible. It's like React and React Native I guess. Apple is
trying to say - instead of - "write once, run anywhere", "learn once,
apply anywhere". They also feel it's not possible to have one size fits
all, as that kind of abstraction would limit the possibilities to
utilize some of the unique features of each apple device. Makes
sense. Found all this info by seeing a bit of this video

https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/240/

I think one sample app tutorial is this

Many tutorial videos here

And tutorials here too

Hmm. I guess I do need to implement VNC Server eh. Not gonna be easy
of course. Will do my research on it. Also, will check out how some
folks have done it here

https://github.com/mitchellh/go-vnc - has only client for now, I think,
even though their plan was to implement server side too :/

https://github.com/bradfitz/rfbgo

I'm going to try only in golang, so my search is refined like
this

https://github.com/search?l=Go&q=vnc&type=Repositories
https://github.com/search?l=Go&q=vnc+server&type=Repositories

I did think about implementing in rust language. But then, I don't
know rust much, and I don't know VNC stuff too. Too many unknowns,
it will slow down the process. So, yeah. For now, golang. I'll
also write tests I guess. To make it robust :) Let's see how it
goes

------------

I simply checked out the code here for some mouse stuff. Just glanced

https://github.com/graciegutman/vnc_server/blob/master/vnc/mouse.go

I see some c language stuff and some cocoa.h header file. Looks like
if I do it in swift language - I could do it in a more native manner?
I don't know. Gotta see

So, I kind of finally realized I'm going to just implement the
RFB protocol.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143

But I think I'll just do some server side stuff. Since there are SO many
clients and they are proper too. May be I'll check some golang client
implementations to understand things better.

So, I need to understand the connection between the protocol and VNC
and what it means to implement a VNC server. And then see what the
functionalities would be - and then choose a language accordingly!
Also, I could try to run the existing programs first. I could try.
No new code (from my side) is better, when existing code can be
reused. Let's see

I got the PDF version of RFB protocol like this -

https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/rfc6143

This is the wikipedia -

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFB_protocol

Wow, so I just found out about another cool software for remote
desktop access by just checking what topics are there in github
for rfb or remote control or remote desktop protocol and more

https://github.com/changkun/occamy

The readme has some good info. One of them mentioned about this

https://guacamole.apache.org/

-----
I started checking if RFB is the only protocol out there. I believed
it to be not the case - and turns out - of course not. I mean, it makes
sense. It's only a protocol - anyone can make it a better one or build
on top of it, change something or add to it etc.

Some links I found while simply searching

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.120

Wow. I found a range of sofwares!!! It's like a treasure. I shouldn't
have searched only for VNC! My bad! There are so many things out there,
of course! Topics I found -
