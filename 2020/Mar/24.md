Today I learned that VS code can run and debug multiple applications. Sounds
obvious? For me it wasn't entirely. I really liked doing it.

What was I even running? I was running helm and it's server component (v2) -
the tiller.

Previously I used to create a docker image with tiller, thinking it can only
run inside the cluster and struggled to debug it 🤦‍♂ It's as simple as just
running `./tiller` , lol

I was able to debug this issue a bit today -
