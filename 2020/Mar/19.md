So, today I spent most of my time checking out change logs for kubernetes
version 1.16.x here

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md

I also noticed in the above changelog that kubernetes now has a fancy site to
checkout release notes! They mentioned it here 
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md#kubernetes-v1160-release-notes

The fancy site is this - https://relnotes.k8s.io/

and it has filtering ! based on versions, areas - like apiserver, kubelet and
so on, and then based on kind - like api-change, bug, deprecation.

So for version 1.16.x, I could use something like this -

https://relnotes.k8s.io/?kinds=bug&kinds=api-change&kinds=deprecation&kinds=feature&releaseVersions=1.16.0&releaseVersions=1.16.1&releaseVersions=1.16.2&releaseVersions=1.16.3&releaseVersions=1.16.4&releaseVersions=1.16.5&releaseVersions=1.16.6

I was checking changelog because we are planning to upgrade our old kubernetes
versions to new ones. We wanted to be sure that there are no breaking changes.
Unfortunately there are a few breaking changes from kubernetes side and some
from GKE side

From kubernetes side, this is what I have for deprecations that our team needs
to checkout and consider -

There's also a plan to move out of all the beta api versions and also out of
the extensions api group, if there are other api groups present and other stable
versions present, instead of beta
