# March 19th 2020

So, today I spent most of my time checking out change logs for kubernetes
version 1.16.x here

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md

I also noticed in the above changelog that kubernetes now has a fancy site to
checkout release notes! They mentioned it here 
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md#kubernetes-v1160-release-notes

The fancy site is this - https://relnotes.k8s.io/

and it has filtering ! based on versions, areas - like apiserver, kubelet and
so on, and then based on kind - like api-change, bug, deprecation.

So for version 1.16.x, I could use something like this -

https://relnotes.k8s.io/?kinds=bug&kinds=api-change&kinds=deprecation&kinds=feature&releaseVersions=1.16.0&releaseVersions=1.16.1&releaseVersions=1.16.2&releaseVersions=1.16.3&releaseVersions=1.16.4&releaseVersions=1.16.5&releaseVersions=1.16.6

I was checking changelog because we are planning to upgrade our old kubernetes
versions to new ones. We wanted to be sure that there are no breaking changes.
Unfortunately there are a few breaking changes from kubernetes side and some
from GKE side

From kubernetes side, this is what I have for deprecations that our team needs
to checkout and consider - 

https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/

There's also a plan to move out of all the beta api versions and also out of
the extensions api group, if there are other api groups present and other stable
versions present, instead of beta

---------------------

So, I was trying to do some testing in my local with new and old versions of
kubernetes. I was using minikube for this

I have minikube a lot of times and hardly faced any issues. Today I faced a
weird issue

```
Error starting cluster: init failed. output: "\n** stderr ** \nv1beta1.ClusterConfiguration.ClusterName: ReadString: expects \" or n, but found 1, error found in #10 byte of ...|terName\":15,\"control|..., bigger context ...|atesDir\":\"/var/lib/minikube/certs\",\"clusterName\":15,\"controlPlaneEndpoint\":\"localhost:8443\",\"dns\":{\"|...\n\n** /stderr **": /bin/bash -c "sudo env PATH=/var/lib/minikube/binaries/v1.15.11:$PATH kubeadm init --config /var/tmp/minikube/kubeadm.yaml  --ignore-preflight-errors=DirAvailable--etc-kubernetes-manifests,DirAvailable--var-lib-minikube,DirAvailable--var-lib-minikube-etcd,FileAvailable--etc-kubernetes-manifests-kube-scheduler.yaml,FileAvailable--etc-kubernetes-manifests-kube-apiserver.yaml,FileAvailable--etc-kubernetes-manifests-kube-controller-manager.yaml,FileAvailable--etc-kubernetes-manifests-etcd.yaml,Port-10250,Swap,SystemVerification": Process exited with status 1

```

Not sure what went wrong. Just got the logs. Need to check. But the status
seems to be running

```
$ minikube profile list
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| Profile  | VM Driver | Runtime |      IP       | Port | Version  | Status  |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|------|----------|---------|
|       15 | hyperkit  | docker  | 192.168.64.22 | 8443 | v1.15.11 | Running |
| minikube | hyperkit  | docker  | 192.168.64.21 | 8443 | v1.16.8  | Running |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|------|----------|---------|
$ minikube status
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

My current profile is - 15 . It means k8s v1.15.11

Okay, kubernetes api server is not working, haha

```
$ k version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17", GitVersion:"v1.17.3", GitCommit:"06ad960bfd03b39c8310aaf92d1e7c12ce618213", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-02-11T18:14:22Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.6", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
The connection to the server 192.168.64.22:8443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```

Okay, I just checked the logs properly to understand the issue. Looks like the
issue is the name I gave. Somehow the name I gave went as `15` as is and not
within double quotes `"`. So, according to yaml, that's a number, and it's
giving error, saying it was expecting a string. Hmm

Not sure what's the problem here - I mean, I can't give a name with just number
in it? ðŸ¤” Need to see if this problem can be fixed or not. Might raise a PR
for minikube later :)

--------

Okay, so today I joined firecracker's community call. I asked questions around
how to contribute and how to learn the internals about VMs and what resources
maintainers use to learn and they were kind enough to help me with some links!
They asked me to checkout awesome-virtualization and also gave links

this is what I found in duckduckgo -

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=github+awesome-virtualization&ia=web

And the links they gave are here -

https://rayanfam.com/topics/hypervisor-from-scratch-part-1/ (there are 7 parts)

https://github.com/Wenzel/awesome-virtualization 

And they also mentioned that they actively label the issues and there are issues
labelled good first issues -

https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Contribute%3A+Good+First+Issue%22

There were multiple questions and discussions around Networking, simplicity,
some single thread and how it needs to be used for compute and cannot be used
easily for network packets
