I recently read some blog posts. I wanted to note em down :)

https://www.dabapps.com/blog/cognitive-load-programming/

A good read on how to do programming considering the person who's going to read
the program, in terms of psychology and the cognitive load it puts on the
person's brain when reading the program and trying to change it for some bug
fix or feature.
