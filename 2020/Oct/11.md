I have been wanting to create a collaborative solution like Visual Studio Code
Live Share but Open Source version of it. There's Atom Teletype that does
something similar. But it works on Atom, not on Visual Studio Code.

Also, I want the plugin to work on other text editors too and not just Visual
Studio Code.

I was trying to choose a name. It was hard. I finally chose this - 
Snapping Shrimp

Got a GitHub Organization based on it -

https://github.com/Snapping-Shrimp
or
https://github.com/snapping-shrimp

And created a GitLab group too

https://gitlab.com/snapping-shrimp

:D

Now, I need to work on something. Hmm. My plan was to create a VS Code basic
extension to understand how it works. And also understand how Atom teletype
works.
