Today I wanted to understand a bit about Scratch https://scratch.mit.edu/ .
I used it last week to create something. I was wondering yesterday how I didn't
check if it's open source. I started digging a bit about it.

I found lots of links at the end of it's web page :P

There's Scratch for Parents - https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/

There's Scratch for Educators - https://scratch.mit.edu/educators ! And there
are Scratch accounts for teachers specifically !

And then there's Scratch for Developers

And that's where a lot of things about code is mentioned! :D :)
