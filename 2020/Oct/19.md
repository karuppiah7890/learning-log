GitLab pattern for auto closing issues in the default branch
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#default-closing-pattern

---

Today I was changing my default git branch from `master` to `main`. I noticed
one issue while doing it.

```bash
$ git branch -m main
$ git push -u origin main
$ # after removing remote master branch
$ git remote prune origin
$ git branch -a
warning: ignoring broken ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
* main
  remotes/origin/main
$ git checkout HEAD
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
$ git branch -a
warning: ignoring broken ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
* main
  remotes/origin/main
$ vi .git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
$ # noticed that it still referred to master and not main
```

Then I searched about it

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=warning%3A+ignoring+broken+ref+refs%2Fremotes%2Forigin%2FHEAD&ia=web&iax=qa

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45811971/warning-ignoring-broken-ref-refs-remotes-origin-head#45867333

Changed it then using this

```bash
$ git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
$ git branch -a
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/main
```

Finally! :) :D
