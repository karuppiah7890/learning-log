What is maven central is down? We think we had issues in our Continous
Integration pipeline because maven central was possibly down

https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/issues/151

https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-mock_service/blob/master/README.md#mock-service-usage

pact mock service issues due to running test before setting up the mock first.

https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/

Tried to run in a controlled environment

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --memory 100m --cpus 1 -v $(pwd):/app node:12.12.0 bash
$ cd /app
$ yarn test test.ts -t 'test' --watchAll=false
```

That failed to even run the pact broker. So, trying again now.
