For nodejs projects in Travis CI, I realized that I don't need to run npm
install - as travis CI already runs it as part of something
called npm ci, their own thing I guess?

Actually, no! It's an actual command by npm itself

```bash
$ npm ci
$ npm help ci
```

`npm-ci - Install a project with a clean slate`
