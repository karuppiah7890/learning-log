Today I learned how to use the Portainer https://www.portainer.io/ dashboard.
I used it to access the logs of a container by choosing Containers section on
the navigation menu and then choosing the container I was interested in and
then clicking on the `Logs` link and then seeing the logs.

It was awesome how it was possible to select log lines, mention the number of
lines for the logs in the UI and also get timestamp if needed. Cool stuff!

I was also able to restart a nginx container from the UI itself :) This way, I
didn't need access to the VM running the containers.

The Portainer dashboard is behind a authentication wall for sure - it uses LDAP
of the company and authenticates people. I haven't checked if it has
authorization though

I also learned how to use generics in Java. I learned it long long ago when I
was in college I think but I had never used it much. Today I used it! :) It was
pretty cool to use!! :)

I also learned a thing or two about how to have test properties in Spring Boot
tests and how to mock and verify a Rest client and how mocking works. I just
saw the code, but I haven't gone too much into the details though. I'll have to
do that next!

I used Mockito, RestTemplate from Spring Boot framework (web)
