Okay, so I have read a lot of articles and blog posts recently.

I want to share em all! :D

And this youtube video a friend shared long ago, which I still haven't
seen

## Open source stuff 1

So, recently I have been thinking about how to contribute to helm, for a
particular issue - 

https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6155

So, currently I'm writing tests, thinking about the functionality of

```
$ helm repo index .
```

The current tasks that I have are

```
- add test for index.json creation
- add test for merging with index.json given index.json to create
index.yaml
- add test for - only one of merge or merge json should be given, not both
- put it all in t.Run() or what? But it's all sequential, and shouldn't be parallel.
So I think this is okay? :)
- write test for load index.json file
- check test coverage for all the code you write
- check which json package to use
- write failure test cases?
```

It's not exactly in proper order. But I'm trying to best to see all possibilities.
Also, I've asked the maintainers a question about an ambiguity

Now, gotta continue on the test. I did write some code, without test. Gotta test
that too! And use coverage to check if everything is tested!

Okay, so VS code shows the code coverage in a really good manner! :D

Wow, so I don't need to do any command line stuff to see how much of the code
is covered in the package that I'm working with!

I also created a small video to show I did it :D

I'm gonna put this on twitter ;)

Now, back to work!

OOOOOh. So I can also find the test file for a given file using VS Code!

I think I'm gonna use the Intellij shortcuts and see what works and what doesn't!

But that will break some of my usual keybindings. Like command shift t, which I
use to undo close tab. Hmm. But I'm very much used to intellij shortcuts. I think
I'll just stick to it for now :) here I come intellij shortcuts!

And I already have sublime keymapping ðŸ˜†

Ouch. It's so weird with intellij key mappings. I think I need to forget VS
code mappings.

cmd b is for definition and not for toggling sidebar. Right. 

cmd 1 is not tab 1. lol. damn thing

Actually, some weird stuff do happen. Anyways, let's see how it goes!

cmd option left

has multiple meanings now. lol.

hmm

anyways, cmd shift t however doesn't work now. I'm just gonna focus on
work now. And get back to this later. :P If intellij shortcut is not working
out, I'll get rid of it :)

okay, not helping much :P and however I'm working with only two files now,
so I'll get rid of it!

Also, I learned some VS code settings from here

https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/vscode.md

Not sure how it helps though ðŸ™ˆ

I also wanted to check what `gopls` is. Looks like it's the language server
for golang

https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/README.md

I think I'll contribute to it someday, after finishing all the things that
I have left out :P

...

Okay, so I wrote some more tests. Broke my head over some issues ðŸ˜… and then
wrote code to fix the failing tests. And now it's all working - the `helm repo index`
command that is :)

Next I'm looking at other `helm repo` sub commands, starting with `helm repo add`,
after that it will be `helm repo update`

lots of questions around the implementation. Let's see what the maintainers tell!

All of the stuff over here -

I think I'm gonna just check some more code and then doze off ðŸ˜´ !
