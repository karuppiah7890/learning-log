What's the `locate` command? Noticed it here - https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/10/26/ninja--a-simple-way-to-do-builds/

https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-locate-command/ - of course, it is to locate files it seems

https://plocate.sesse.net/ - this is faster it seems

`find` is slow it seems. What about `fd` ? Is it faster than locate? ðŸ¤” Hmm
