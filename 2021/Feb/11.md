The concept of website notes - as a plugin for the browser

So, when we land on a particular website or web page in a website, then we can
pull up our notes regarding that website.

Use case, in my case, I have a dummy ecommerce store. I can only order some
particular set of items in this store. I can easily store this as a note in the
browser plugin storage, which I pull up later.

It's like notes app, but particularly for a website and you can also pull up
notes for other websites too when being on a website, I guess. Hmm

The idea came to me because there's already a password manager which works like
this. A plugin that is. Which helps me put in passwords based on the website.
So yeah. :) That's how I could relate to passwords and then simple notes and
thought why not have that too as a plugin :)
