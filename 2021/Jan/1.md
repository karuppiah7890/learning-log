Steps to update a gofish package

- Go to the gofish git repo
- Checkout to main branch
- Sync / Update main branch with the source main branch
- Delete any stale branches in remote and local (Nice to have)
  - Any branch that has been merged to main is a stale branch
- Checkout to a new branch called update-{package}
  - If there's already such a branch, checkout to that
  - Rebase with main branch
- Find the latest version of the package using the package's releases
  - For github, this is the releases page - latest release tag
- Use uff tool to update the Food/{package}.lua to the latest version
- Add all the changed files - ideally only Food/{package}.lua , so maybe just
  that
- Commit the change with "{package} v{version}"
- Force Push the change to the forked repo
- Open a new pull request with the forked as source repo for PR and main repo
  as target repo for PR
