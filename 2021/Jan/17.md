I like the PS. "The problem is we don't have time to analyse and see the clear picture." Makes a lot of sense. A lot of us are in the hustle. Hustlemania. I think that not much time is not spent on being idle or analyzing what's going on usually. At least I notice that in myself. Also, I have noticed this one perspective where a friend mentioned how workers like us, who need money, need to keep working, so we don't have much time to relax. Imagine people working more than one job to keep the family running. And then there are rich people, who probably don't have to work much and hence clearly have the time to relax and think. It makes sense to me. So, what others can do is, whatever time they find, they can think about how to use it and probably not hustle it. It's not easy for me though, but I try ðŸ˜…ðŸ™ˆ
