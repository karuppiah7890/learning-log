I noticed the edx platform open source code today!

https://github.com/edx/edx-platform

https://github.com/edx

https://open.edx.org/

https://www.edx.org/

It's apparently used in the Redis University site https://university.redislabs.com/ ! Pretty interesting! I noticed this in my account settings

I have heard of edX before but I don't think I have extensively used it. It's good to know that there are interesting open source platforms to host and use for hosting courses! :D I know the closed source ones like Google Classroom and GitHub Classroom among others
