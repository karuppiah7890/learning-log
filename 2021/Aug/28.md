# August 28th 2021

I was checking out GitHub CLI 2.0 and it's interesting!!

GitHub CLI 2.0 has been making my life easier recently. For example I checkout to a PR branch locally with just one command very easily.

Recently they seem to have released GitHub CLI extensions!!

https://github.blog/2021-08-24-github-cli-2-0-includes-extensions/

https://github.com/cli/cli/discussions/4183

And I have been looking to check on how to convert a PR to draft from GitHub web interface but didn't find any option for it

There's a GitHub CLI extension for it now!

I was just messing with the extension and also checking what it does when I do `-h`

There's a feature request in GitHub CLI for converting an existing ready-for-review PR to draft

Ah, now I remember how to convert to draft in GitHub web interface. I had forgotten that I did see links of `Convert to draft` long ago in PRs. It was a small thing in the reviewers section. I can convert my PRs to draft and for converting others PRs to draft I need write access to the repo.

https://github.blog/changelog/2020-04-08-convert-pull-request-to-draft/

I need to look for `Still in progress? Convert to draft` and click on `Convert to draft` link, right. I forgot. Anyways, `gh` CLI is still cool!
